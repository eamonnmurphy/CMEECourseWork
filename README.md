# My CMEE Coursework Repository

Coursework for MSc of Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution (CMEE), at ICL Silwood Park campus. Work is mostly based on [TheMulQuaBio](https://github.com/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio) Jupyter Notebook course on quantitative biology. Groupwork scripts completed for the course are also included, and are the work of [Booming Bonobos](https://github.com/eamonnmurphy/Booming_Bonobos).

### Usage
Directories are organised by week, with each week covering a different topic. Each week should contain code, data, results and sandbox subdirectories, along with a README file explaining the contents. Scripts can be run from the code directory, and will access files from data, with outputs saved to results. Results directory is empty until populated by the user (except for a .gitkeep file). Packages and dependencies for the code in each week is detailed individually in their README.

To clone this repository, copy and paste the code snippet below to your terminal:
