## Week Two

This subdirectory contains work completed for week 2 of CMEE MSc Course, Biological Computing in Python. Topics include data structure, loops, control flow, scope and code compartmentalisation for Python. This code was written in Python 3.8.10. More detailed usage instructions are available in the main repository README.

### Packages
* csv version 1.0
* pickle
* sys
* doctest

### Scripts
* align_seqs.py - find and store the best aligned sequence for the given sequence files
* basic_csv.py - opening and reading csv files
* basic_io1.py - reading .txt files
* basic_io2.py - writing to files
* basic_io3.py - using pickle to read and write
* boilerplate.<span>py - simple example of using main function
* cfexercises1<span>.py - module to demonstrate control flow
* cfexercises2<span>.py - further control flow exercises

#### Groupwork scripts
* align_seqs_fasta.py - allows input of fasta files for sequence alignment
* align_seqs_better.py - saves all best alignments, not just the final one found
  
### Data
* bodymass.csv - list of species with their body mass
* JustOaksData.csv - only the oak species from TestOaksData.csv
* seq.csv - example DNA sequence
* testcsv.csv  - example csv file
* TestOaksData.csv - list of tree species
