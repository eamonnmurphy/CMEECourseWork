  abstract = {Cilia both receive and send information, the latter in the form of extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are nano-communication devices that influence cell, tissue, and organism behavior. Mechanisms driving ciliary EV biogenesis are almost entirely unknown. Here, we show that the ciliary G-protein Rab28, associated with human autosomal recessive cone-rod dystrophy, negatively regulates EV levels in the sensory organs of Caenorhabditis elegans in a cilia specific manner. Sequential targeting of lipidated Rab28 to periciliary and ciliary membranes is highly dependent on the BBSome and the prenyl-binding protein phosphodiesterase 6 subunit delta (PDE6D), respectively, and BBSome loss causes excessive and ectopic EV production. We also find that EV defective mutants display abnormalities in sensory compartment morphogenesis. Together, these findings reveal that Rab28 and the BBSome are key in vivo regulators of EV production at the periciliary membrane and suggest that EVs may mediate signaling between cilia and glia to shape sensory organ compartments. Our data also suggest that defects in the biogenesis of cilia-related EVs may contribute to human ciliopathies.},

In humans, abnormal aggression is a hallmark of neuropsychiatric disorders and can be elicited by environmental factors acting on an underlying genetic susceptibility. Identifying the genetic architecture that predisposes to aggressive behavior in people is challenging because of difficulties in quantifying the phenotype, genetic heterogeneity, and uncontrolled environmental conditions. Studies on mice have identified single-gene mutations that result in hyperaggression, contingent on genetic background. These studies can be complemented by systems genetics approaches in Drosophila melanogaster, in which mutational analyses together with genome-wide transcript analyses, artificial selection studies, and genome-wide analysis of epistasis have revealed that a large segment of the genome contributes to the manifestation of aggressive behavior with widespread epistatic interactions. Comparative genomic analyses based on the principle of evolutionary conservation are needed to enable a complete dissection of the neurogenetic underpinnings of this universal fitness trait.},

  abstract = {Seeing Spots Some flies in the Drosophila melanogaster lineage exhibit wing spots, which vary among species. Examining the underlying genetics of spot determination, Arnoult et al. (p. 1423) provide evidence for a two-step scenario for the origin and diversification of patterning novelty in these fly wings. The findings suggest that the two-step model may generally apply to the emergence and diversification of traits in plants and animals. The typical pattern of morphological evolution associated with the radiation of a group of related species is the emergence of a novel trait and its subsequent diversification. Yet the genetic mechanisms associated with these two evolutionary steps are poorly characterized. Here, we show that a spot of dark pigment on fly wings emerged from the assembly of a novel gene regulatory module in which a set of pigmentation genes evolved to respond to a common transcriptional regulator determining their spatial distribution. The primitive wing spot pattern subsequently diversified through changes in the expression pattern of this regulator. These results suggest that the genetic changes underlying the emergence and diversification of wing pigmentation patterns are partitioned within genetic networks. Pigmentation spots on the wings of flies originate from changes at different levels of the underlying genetic hierarchy.

Such phylodynamic inferences can however become quite time-consuming as the dimensions of the data increase, which has led to a myriad of approaches that aim to tackle this complexity. To elucidate the current state of the art in the field of phylodynamics, we discuss recent developments in Bayesian inference and accompanying software, highlight methods for improving computational efficiency and relevant visualisation tools. As an alternative to fully Bayesian approaches, we touch upon conditional software pipelines that compromise between statistical coherence and turn-around-time, and we highlight the available software packages. Finally, we outline future directions that may facilitate the large-scale tracking of epidemics in near real time.},

Although widespread parallels have been found for major effect loci, much less is known about genes that control quantitative trait variation. In this study, we identify and compare the loci that control subtle changes in the size and shape of forewing pattern elements in two Heliconius butterfly co-mimics. We use quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis with a multivariate phenotyping approach to map the variation in red pattern elements across the whole forewing surface of Heliconius erato and Heliconius melpomene. These results are compared with a QTL analysis of univariate trait changes, and show that our resolution for identifying small effect loci is somewhat improved with the multivariate approach, but also that different loci are detected with these different approaches. QTL likely corresponding to the known patterning gene optix were found in both species but otherwise, a remarkably low level of genetic parallelism was found. This lack of similarity indicates that the genetic basis of convergent traits may not be as predictable as assumed from studies that focus solely on Mendelian traits.},

In adverse circumstances, for example, small size and slow metabolism can facilitate survival, whereas larger size and more rapid metabolism have advantages for reproductive success when resources are more abundant. Often these characteristics are induced in early life or are even set by cues to which their parents or grandparents were exposed. Individuals developmentally adapted to one environment may, however, be at risk when exposed to another when they are older. The biological evidence may be relevant to the understanding of human development and susceptibility to disease. As the nutritional state of many human mothers has improved around the world, the characteristics of their offspring\textemdash such as body size and metabolism\textemdash have also changed. Responsiveness to their mothers' condition before birth may generally prepare individuals so that they are best suited to the environment forecast by cues available in early life. Paradoxically, however, rapid improvements in nutrition and other environmental conditions may have damaging effects on the health of those people whose parents and grandparents lived in impoverished conditions. A fuller understanding of patterns of human plasticity in response to early nutrition and other environmental factors will have implications for the administration of public health.},

Over 40 PrCa GWAS have been reported, with approximately 170 common variants now identified., Clinical utility of these variants could include strategies for population-based risk stratification to target PrCa screening to men with an increased genetic risk of disease development, while for those who develop PrCa, identifying genetic variants could allow treatment to be tailored based on a genetic profile in the early disease setting. Functional studies of identified variants are needed to fully understand underlying mechanisms of disease and identify novel targets for treatment. This review will outline the GWAS carried out in PrCa and the common variants identified so far, and how these may be utilised clinically in the screening for and management of PrCa.},

Population density at carrying capacity plays an important role in evolutionary processes, biodiversity, and ecosystem function, yet how it varies with temperature-dependent metabolism remains unclear. Though the exponential effect of temperature on intrinsic population growth rate, r, is well known, we still lack clear evidence that population density at carrying capacity, K, declines with increasing per capita metabolic rate, as predicted by the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE). We experimentally tested whether temperature effects on photosynthesis propagate directly to population carrying capacity in a model species, the mobile phytoplankton Tetraselmis tetrahele. After maintaining populations at a fixed resource supply and fixed temperatures for 43 days, we found that carrying capacity declined with increasing temperature. This decline was predicted quantitatively when models included temperature-dependent metabolic rates and temperature-associated body-size shifts. Our results demonstrate that warming reduces carrying capacity and that temperature effects on body size and metabolic rate interact to determine how temperature affects population dynamics. These findings bolster efforts to relate metabolic temperature dependence to population and ecosystem patterns via MTE.},

The situation is most critical for a large clade of spiny-finned fishes, traditionally referred to as percomorphs, whose uncertain relationships have plagued ichthyologists for over a century. Most of what we know about the higher-level relationships among fish lineages has been based on morphology, but rapid influx of molecular studies is changing many established systematic concepts. We report a comprehensive molecular phylogeny for bony fishes that includes representatives of all major lineages. DNA sequence data for 21 molecular markers (one mitochondrial and 20 nuclear genes) were collected for 1410 bony fish taxa, plus four tetrapod species and two chondrichthyan outgroups (total 1416 terminals). Bony fish diversity is represented by 1093 genera, 369 families, and all traditionally recognized orders. The maximum likelihood tree provides unprecedented resolution and high bootstrap support for most backbone nodes, defining for the first time a global phylogeny of fishes. The general structure of the tree is in agreement with expectations from previous morphological and molecular studies, but significant new clades arise. Most interestingly, the high degree of uncertainty among percomorphs is now resolved into nine well-supported supraordinal groups. The order Perciformes, considered by many a polyphyletic taxonomic waste basket, is defined for the first time as a monophyletic group in the global phylogeny. A new classification that reflects our phylogenetic hypothesis is proposed to facilitate communication about the newly found structure of the tree of life of fishes. Finally, the molecular phylogeny is calibrated using 60 fossil constraints to produce a comprehensive time tree. The new time-calibrated phylogeny will provide the basis for and stimulate new comparative studies to better understand the evolution of the amazing diversity of fishes.},

Instead, the trend has been to rely, in varying degrees, on deep-rooted anatomical concepts and authority, often mixing taxa with explicit phylogenetic support with arbitrary groupings. Two leading sources in ichthyology frequently used for fish classifications (JS Nelson's volumes of Fishes of the World and W. Eschmeyer's Catalog of Fishes) fail to adopt a global phylogenetic framework despite much recent progress made towards the resolution of the fish Tree of Life. The first explicit phylogenetic classification of bony fishes was published in 2013, based on a comprehensive molecular phylogeny (www.deepfin.org).

Our model-fitting suggestions range from general cultural advice (where possible, use the tools and models that are most common in your subfield) to specific suggestions about how to change the mathematical description of models to make them more amenable to parameter estimation. A companion web site (https://groups.nceas.ucsb.edu/non-linear-modeling/projects) presents detailed examples of application of the three tools to a variety of typical ecological estimation problems; each example links both to a detailed project report and to full source code and data.},

  abstract = {How a nervous system assembles and coordinates a suite of elementary behavioral steps into a complex behavior is not well understood. While often presented as a stereotyped sequence of events, even extensively studied behaviors such as fly courtship are rarely a strict repetition of the same steps in a predetermined sequence in time. We are focusing on oviposition, the act of laying an egg, in flies of the genus Drosophila to describe the elementary behavioral steps or microbehaviors that a single female fly undertakes prior to and during egg laying. We have analysed the hierarchy and relationships in time of these microbehaviors in 3 closely related Drosophila species with divergent egg-laying preferences, and uncovered cryptic differences in their behavioral patterns. Using high-speed imaging, we quantified in depth the oviposition behavior of single females of Drosophila suzukii, Drosophila biarmipes and Drosophila melanogaster in a novel behavioral assay. By computing transitions between microbehaviors, we identified a common ethogram structure underlying oviposition of all three species. Quantifying parameters such as relative time spent on a microbehavior and its average duration, however, revealed clear differences between species. In addition, we examined the temporal dynamics and probability of transitions to different microbehaviors relative to a central event of oviposition, ovipositor contact. Although the quantitative analysis highlights behavioral variability across flies, it reveals some interesting trends for each species in the mode of substrate sampling, as well as possible evolutionary differences. Larger dataset derived from automated video annotation will overcome this paucity of data in the future, and use the same framework to reappraise these observed differences. Our study reveals a common architecture to the oviposition ethogram of 3 Drosophila species, indicating its ancestral state. It also indicates that Drosophila suzukii's behavior departs quantitatively and qualitatively from that of the outgroup species, in line with its known divergent ethology. Together, our results illustrate how a global shift in ethology breaks down in the quantitative reorganization of the elementary steps underlying a complex behavior.},

  abstract = {The use of primary mathematical models with curve fitting software is dramatically changing quantitative food microbiology. The two most widely used primary growth models are the Baranyi and Gompertz models. A three-phase linear model was developed to determine how well growth curves could be described using a simpler model. The model divides bacterial growth curves into three phases: the lag and stationary phases where the specific growth rate is zero (gm=0), and the exponential phase where the logarithm of the bacterial population increases linearly with time (gm=constant). The model has four parameters: No(Log8of initial population density), NMAX(Log8of final population density), tLAG(time when lag phase ends), and tMAX(time when exponential phase ends). A comparison of the linear model was made against the Baranyi and Gompertz models, using established growth data forEscherichia coli0157:H7. The growth curves predicted by the three models showed good agreement. The linear model was more `robust' than the others, especially when experimental data were minimal. The physiological assumptions underlying the linear model are discussed, with particular emphasis on assuring that the model is consistent with bacterial behavior both as individual cells and as populations. It is proposed that the transitional behavior of bacteria at the end of the lag phase can be explained on the basis of biological variability.},

This unexpectedly narrow range of diversity is known as Lewontin's Paradox of Variation (1974). While some have suggested selection constrains diversity, tests of this hypothesis seem to fall short. Here, I revisit Lewontin's Paradox to assess whether current models of linked selection are capable of reducing diversity to this extent. To quantify the discrepancy between pairwise diversity and census population sizes across species, I combine previously-published estimates of pairwise diversity from 172 metazoan taxa with newly derived estimates of census sizes. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, I show this relationship is significant accounting for phylogeny, but with high phylogenetic signal and evidence that some lineages experience shifts in the evolutionary rate of diversity deep in the past. Additionally, I find a negative relationship between recombination map length and census size, suggesting abundant species have less recombination and experience greater reductions in diversity due to linked selection. However, I show that even assuming strong and abundant selection, models of linked selection are unlikely to explain the observed relationship between diversity and census sizes across species.}

The lncRNA CCAT2 is dysregulated in several cancers such as colon cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, gastric cancer, and breast cancer; however, the contributions of CCAT2 to breast cancer remain largely unknown. In the current paper, we first confirmed the high expression level of CCAT2 in breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay, and we further analyzed the relationship between CCAT2 expression and clinical prognostic factors. Also, the biological function of CCAT2 was explored and the results showed silencing of CCAT2 could suppress cell growth in vitro and tumor formation in vivo. Finally, our results revealed that the abnormal expression of CCAT2 could influence the Wnt signaling pathway. In conclusion, lncRNA CCAT2 might be considered as a novel molecule involved in breast cancer development, which provides a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.,},

Technologies ranging from restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq), to whole genome sequencing and assembly, to transcriptomics, to CRISPR are revolutionizing the means by which investigators can both frame and test hypotheses of lineage diversification. Our review aims to examine both extrinsic and intrinsic aspects of speciation. Genome-scale data have already served to fundamentally clarify the role of gene flow during (and after) speciation, although we predict that the differential propensity for speciation among phylogenetic lineages will be one of the most exciting frontiers for future genomic investigation. We propose that a unified theory of speciation will take into account the idiosyncratic features of genomic architecture examined in the light of each organism's biology and ecology drawn from across the full breadth of the Tree of Life.},

We then focus on the bottom part of the wage distribution and compare the number of excess jobs paying at or slightly above the new minimum wage to the missing jobs paying below it to infer the employment effect. We find that the overall number of low-wage jobs remained essentially unchanged over the five years following the increase. At the same time, the direct effect of the minimum wage on average earnings was amplified by modest wage spillovers at the bottom of the wage distribution. Our estimates by detailed demographic groups show that the lack of job loss is not explained by labor-labor substitution at the bottom of the wage distribution. We also find no evidence of disemployment when we consider higher levels of minimum wages. However, we do find some evidence of reduced employment in tradeable sectors. We also show how decomposing the overall employment effect by wage bins allows a transparent way of assessing the plausibility of estimates.},

  abstract = {Background The Recombination Activating Proteins, RAG1 and RAG2, play a crucial role in the immune response in vertebrates. Among the nuclear markers currently used for phylogenetic purposes, Rag1 has especially enjoyed enormous popularity, since it successfully contributed to elucidating the relationships among and within a large variety of vertebrate lineages. We here report on a comparative investigation of the genetic variation, base composition, presence of indels, and selection in Rag1 in different vertebrate lineages (Actinopterygii, Amphibia, Aves, Chondrichthyes, Crocodylia, Lepidosauria, Mammalia, and Testudines) through the analysis of 582 sequences obtained from Genbank. We also analyze possible differences between distinct parts of the gene with different type of protein functions. Results In the vertebrate lineages studied, Rag1 is over 3 kb long. We observed a high level of heterogeneity in base composition at the 3rd codon position in some of the studied vertebrate lineages and in some specific taxa. This result is also paralleled by taxonomic differences in the GC content at the same codon position. Moreover, positive selection occurs at some sites in Aves, Lepidosauria and Testudines. Indels, which are often used as phylogenetic characters, are more informative across vertebrates in the 5' than in the 3'-end of the gene. When the entire gene is considered, the use of indels as phylogenetic character only recovers one major vertebrate clade, the Actinopterygii. However, in numerous cases insertions or deletions are specific to a monophyletic group. Conclusions Rag1 is a phylogenetic marker of undoubted quality. Our study points to the need of carrying out a preliminary investigation on the base composition and the possible existence of sites under selection of this gene within the groups studied to avoid misleading resolution. The gene shows highly heterogeneous base composition, which affects some taxa in particular and contains sites under positive selection in some vertebrate lineages in the 5'-end. The first part of the gene (5'-end) is more variable than the second (3'-end), and less affected by a heterogeneous base composition. However, in some vertebrate lineages the 5'-end of the gene is not yet widely used for phylogenetic studies.},

While these experiments mapped the gene accurately, they also illustrated some complexities of this method. Rescue results showed that a 2.8 kb genomic fragment from this interval was able to fully rescue the cortex phenotype. The 2.8 kb rescuing fragment contains a single open reading frame. The predicted amino acid sequence indicates that cortex encodes a WD-repeat protein and is a distant member of the Cdc20 protein family. Results from a developmental Northern analysis showed that the cortex transcript is expressed at high levels during oogenesis and early embryogenesis. Interestingly, the meiotic metaphase-anaphase II arrest defect in embryos laid by cortex homozygous females resembles the mitotic metaphase-anaphase defects observed in yeast cdc20 mutants. The predicted nature of the Cortex protein, together with the observed meiotic phenotype in cortex mutants, suggest that a similar pathway to the cdc20 dependent APC-mediated proteolysis pathway, which governs the metaphase-anaphase transition in mitosis, is also important in regulating oocyte meiosis. genesis 29:141\textendash 152, 2001. \textcopyright{} 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Using CRISPR-Cas9 we re-examine the function of Distal-less (Dll) as an activator or repressor of eyespots, a topic that remains controversial. We show that the phenotypic outcome of CRISPR mutations depends upon which specific exon is targeted. In Bicyclus anynana, exon 2 mutations are associated with both missing and ectopic eyespots, and also exon skipping. Exon 3 mutations, which do not lead to exon skipping, produce only null phenotypes, including missing eyespots, lighter wing coloration and loss of scales. Reaction-diffusion modeling of Dll function, using Wnt and Dpp as candidate morphogens, accurately replicates these complex crispant phenotypes. These results provide new insight into the function of Dll as a potential activator of eyespot development, scale growth and melanization, and suggest that the tuning of Dll expression levels can generate a diversity of eyespot phenotypes, including their appearance on the wing.

  abstract = {The successful landmark discovery of mouse and human inducible pluripotential stem cells (iPSC's) by Takahashi and Yamanaka in 2006 and 2007 has triggered a revolution in the potential generation of self-compatible cells for regenerative medicine, and further opened up a new avenue for "disease in dish" drug screening of self-target cells (Neofytou et al. 2015). The introduction of four 'Yamanaka' transcription factors through viral or other transfection of mature cells can induce pluripotency and acquired plasticity. These factors include transduction with octamer-binding transcription factor-4 (Oct-4), nanog homeobox (Nanog), sex-determining region Y-box-2 (Sox-2) and MYC protooncogene (cMyc). Such cells become iPSC's (Takahashi and Yamanaka 2006). These reprogrammed cells exhibit increased telomerase activity and have a hypomethylated gene promotor region similar to embryonic stem cells (ESC's). These milestone discoveries have generated immense hope that diseases such as diabetes could be treated and effectively cured by transplantation of self-compatible, personalized autologous stem cell transplantation of {$\beta$}-cells that release physiological insulin under glycemic control (Maehr et al. 2009; Park et al. 2008) (Fig. 1). Diabetes is a profligate disease of disordered glucose metabolism resulting from an absolute or relative deficiency of insulin, the consequences of which lead to immense socio-economic societal burden. While there are many different types of diabetes, the two major types (type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are caused respectively by immune-mediated destruction (T1DM) or malfunctioning (T2DM) insulin-producing {$\beta$}-cells within the endocrine pancreas, the islets of Langerhans (Atkinson et al. 2011; Holman et al. 2015; You and Henneberg 2016). Almost 425~million people are affected by the global burden of diabetes, and this is predicted to increase by 48\% (629~million) by 2045 (International Diabetes Federation Atlas 8th Ed 2018). Whole pancreas or islet cell transplantation offer an effective alternative to injected insulin, but both require lifelong potent immunosuppression to control both allo-and autoimmunity. Whole pancreas transplantation involves invasive complex surgery and is associated with greater morbidity and occasional mortality, while islet transplantation involves a minimally invasive intraportal hepatic infusion. Generally, whole pancreas transplantation provides greater metabolic reserve, but this may be matched by cumulative multiple islet infusions to achieve insulin independence. An additional challenge of islet transplantation is progressive loss of complete insulin independence over time, which may be multifactorial, the dominant factor however being ineffective control of autoimmunity. Both whole pancreas and islet transplantation are restricted to patients at risk of severe hypoglycemia that cannot be stabilized by alternate means, or in recipients that are already immunosuppressed in order to sustain a kidney or other solid organ transplant. The risks of chronic immunosuppression and the scarcity of human organ donors mean that both of these transplantation therapies cannot presently be extended to the broader diabetic population (Shapiro 2011; Shapiro et al. 2006). Recent progress in xenotransplantation of multiple knock-out 'humanized' pig islets could offer one potential solution, perhaps aided by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR associated-9 (CRISPR/Cas-9) gene editing approaches, but this remains to be proven in practice. Human stem cell derived new {$\beta$}-cell products could effectively address the global supply challenge for broad application across all forms of diabetes, but recurrent autoimmunity may still remain an insurmountable challenge. Considerable progress in the generation of human stem cell derived SC-{$\beta$} cells from ESC, iPS and other adult cell sources such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) offer huge hope that a personalized, 'syngeneic' cell could be transplanted without risk of alloimmunity, thereby securing sufficient supply to meet future global demand (Cito et al. 2018).},

Previous genome-wide association (GWA) studies of cognitive functions have found evidence for polygenic effects yet, to date, there are few replicated genetic associations. Here we use data from the UK Biobank sample to investigate the genetic contributions to variation in tests of three cognitive functions and in educational attainment. GWA analyses were performed for verbal\textendash numerical reasoning (N=36\,035), memory (N=112\,067), reaction time (N=111\,483) and for the attainment of a college or a university degree (N=111\,114). We report genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based associations in 20 genomic regions, and significant gene-based findings in 46 regions. These include findings in the ATXN2, CYP2DG, APBA1 and CADM2 genes. We report replication of these hits in published GWA studies of cognitive function, educational attainment and childhood intelligence. There is also replication, in UK Biobank, of SNP hits reported previously in GWA studies of educational attainment and cognitive function. GCTA-GREML analyses, using common SNPs (minor allele frequency{$>$}0.01), indicated significant SNP-based heritabilities of 31\% (s.e.m.=1.8\%) for verbal\textendash numerical reasoning, 5\% (s.e.m.=0.6\%) for memory, 11\% (s.e.m.=0.6\%) for reaction time and 21\% (s.e.m.=0.6\%) for educational attainment. Polygenic score analyses indicate that up to 5\% of the variance in cognitive test scores can be predicted in an independent cohort. The genomic regions identified include several novel loci, some of which have been associated with intracranial volume, neurodegeneration, Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.},

However, many assertions regarding peripheral populations rest on the long-standing but poorly tested supposition that peripheral populations exhibit low genetic diversity and greater genetic differentiation as a consequence of smaller effective population size and greater geographical isolation relative to geographically central populations. We reviewed 134 studies representing 115 species that tested for declines in within-population genetic diversity and/or increases in among-population differentiation towards range margins using nuclear molecular genetic markers. On average, 64.2\% of studies detected the expected decline in diversity, 70.2\% of those that tested for it showed increased differentiation and there was a positive association between these trends. In most cases, however, the difference in genetic diversity between central and peripheral population was not large. Although these results were consistent across plants and animals, strong taxonomic and biogeographical biases in the available studies call for a cautious generalization of these results. Despite the large number of studies testing these simple predictions, very few attempted to test possible mechanisms causing reduced peripheral diversity or increased differentiation. Almost no study incorporated a phylogeographical framework to evaluate historical influences on contemporary genetic patterns. Finally, there has been little effort to test whether these geographical trends in putatively neutral variation at marker loci are reflected by quantitative genetic trait variation, which is likely to influence the adaptive potential of populations across the geographical range.},

In single gene disorders of higher frequency, especially X-linked ones, the frequency of combined germ-line and somatic mosaicism is increasingly being appreciated, e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Cell separation techniques; such as the fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) also detect much somatic mosaicism among blood cells in disorders such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Depending on the disorder and the class of mutation, in genes for which there are sufficient numbers of patients studied, 6\textendash 20\% of cases are due to somatic mutation. This update of my previous review is stimulated by the rapid application of new technologies for the study of DNA variation in disease. The results of these studies implicate somatic mutation in a greater variety of genetic diseases and a wider spectrum of tissues than have previously been shown, including heart and kidney. The classes of mutation have also expanded beyond base pair changes, insertions/deletion (indels), and short tandem repeat mutations to include copy number variants and transposon-mediated mutations. I also briefly discuss previously well-known mosaicism for chromosomal mutations. Genomic sequencing, performed on DNA from blood, shows many mutations which are conclusively somatic in origin. It is still too early to see if there is a different pattern of somatic mutation compared to germ-line mutation. Though the parameters to allow careful quantification are not yet available, it seems that the frequency of gene mutation in embryonic cells is not markedly different than that in the germ line.},

  abstract = {In Chance, Development, and Aging, two leading biological gerontologists review and evaluate all of the available data to elucidate the respective roles played by genes and chance developmental events in determining the course of aging in individuals. The combination of genetic and external environmental influences provides only an incomplete answer. Inbred laboratory animals, for example, exhibit a wide range of life spans despite having nearly identical genes and environments. Similarly, uncovering the genetic risks for Alzheimer's disease has not enabled doctors to predict with confidence its onset and severity. This book argues that understanding chance events, specifically random variations during prenatal development, is essential for answering these questions. The book draws on the extensive research in developmental biology on random variations in form and function, while putting this research in a new context. The discussion sheds light on a range of questions, from understanding menopause to explaining why identical twins are not truly identical. The book will be invaluable for gerontologists, geneticists, developmental and reproductive biologists, physiologists, and a broad range of physicians and investigators in experimental medicine.},

Eighty-six high performance rugby league players underwent measurements of anthropometric (height, body mass, sum of seven skinfolds), physiological (speed, change of direction speed, lower body muscular power, repeated-sprint ability, prolonged high-intensity intermittent running ability, and maximal aerobic power), technical skill (tackling proficiency, draw and pass proficiency), and perceptual skill (reactive agility, pattern recall, pattern prediction) qualities. A linear discriminant analysis was also conducted comparing those players successful in gaining selection into the professional National Rugby League team with those not selected to determine which, if any, of these qualities could predict selection. Players selected to play in the first National Rugby League game of the season were older, more experienced, leaner, had faster 10m and 40m sprint times, and superior vertical jump performances, maximal aerobic power, tackling proficiency and dual-task draw and pass ability than non-selected players. Skinfold thickness and dual-task draw and pass proficiency were the only variables that contributed significantly (P {$<$} 0.05) to the discriminant analysis of selected and non-selected players. These findings suggest that selected physiological, anthropometric, and skill qualities may influence team selection in professional rugby league.},

In most cases, cooked chicken breast showed the highest microbial count, followed by raw breast and lastly salted breast. The data obtained here were useful for the generation of mathematical models and parameters. The models presented high correlation and can be used for predictive purposes in the poultry meat supply chain.},

In this study, we traced the fate of adult {$\beta$} cells after Pdx1 deletion. As expected, {$\beta$}-cell-specific removal of Pdx1 resulted in severe hyperglycemia within days. Surprisingly, a large fraction of Pdx1-deleted cells rapidly acquired ultrastructural and physiological features of {$\alpha$} cells, indicating that a robust cellular reprogramming had occurred. Reprogrammed cells exhibited a global transcriptional shift that included derepression of the {$\alpha$} cell transcription factor MafB, resulting in a transcriptional profile that closely resembled that of {$\alpha$} cells. These findings indicate that Pdx1 acts as a~master regulator of {$\beta$} cell fate by simultaneously activating genes essential for {$\beta$} cell identity and repressing those associated with {$\alpha$} cell identity. We discuss the significance of these findings in the context of the emerging notion that loss of {$\beta$} cell identity contributes to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.},

While some environmental conditions can be beneficial and result in adaptive responses, others can lead to pathological behaviors. Many studies have demonstrated that changes induced by the environment are expressed not only by the individuals directly exposed, but also by the offspring sometimes across multiple generations. Epigenetic alterations have been proposed as underlying mechanisms for such transmissible effects. Here, we review the most relevant literature on these changes and the developmental stages they affect the most. We discuss current evidence for transgenerational effects of prenatal and postnatal factors on bodily functions and behavioral responses, and the potential epigenetic mechanisms involved. We also discuss the need for a careful evaluation of the evolutionary importance with respect to health and disease, and possible directions for future research in the field.},

To perform these functions, cilia must maintain a composition distinct from those of the contiguous cytosol and plasma membrane. The specialized composition of the cilium depends on the ciliary gate, the region at the ciliary base separating the cilium from the rest of the cell. The ciliary gate's main structural features are electron dense struts connecting microtubules to the adjacent membrane. These structures include the transition fibers, which connect the distal basal body to the base of the ciliary membrane, and the Y-links, which connect the proximal axoneme and ciliary membrane within the transition zone. Both transition fibers and Y-links form early during ciliogenesis and play key roles in ciliary assembly and trafficking. Accordingly, many human ciliopathies are caused by mutations that perturb ciliary gate function.},

  abstract = {In long-distance competitive cycling, efforts to mitigate the effects of air resistance can significantly reduce the energy expended by the cyclist. A common method to achieve such reductions is for the riders to cycle in one large group, known as the peloton. However, to win a race a cyclist must break away from the peloton, losing the advantage of drag reduction and riding solo to cross the finish line ahead of the other riders. If the rider breaks away too soon then fatigue effects due to the extra pedal force required to overcome the additional drag will result in them being caught by the peloton. On the other hand, if the rider breaks away too late then they will not maximize their time advantage over the main field. In this paper, we derive a mathematical model for the motion of the peloton and breakaway rider and use asymptotic analysis techniques to derive analytical solutions for their behaviour. The results are used to predict the optimum time for a rider to break away that maximizes the finish time ahead of the peloton for a given course profile and rider statistics.},

This Article demonstrates the transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of a complex trait: acquired longevity in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. The manipulation of H3K4me3 chromatin modifiers of the ASH-2 complex in the parental generation extends the lifespan of the descendents for three subsequent generations. These findings imply that chromatin changes in parents might not be entirely reset between generations, and provide the first evidence for epigenetic inheritance of lifespan. The H3K4me3 regulatory complex is conserved in mammals, but more work is needed to determine whether manipulations of the complex have a heritable effect on longevity in mammals.},

  abstract = {Abstract The identifiability properties of the Baranyi model for bacterial growth were investigated, both structurally and applied to real-life data. Using the Taylor-series approach, it was formally proven that the model is structurally identifiable, i.e. it is now ascertained that it is certainly possible to give unique values to all parameters of the model, provided the bacterial growth data are of sufficiently good quality. The model also has acceptable practical identifiability properties in the presence of realistic data, which means that the confidence intervals on the parameter values are reasonable. However, there was a relatively high correlation between the maximum specific growth rate {$\mu$} max and the suitability indicator h 0 . An optimal experimental design to improve parameter estimation uncertainty was worked out, using the sampling times of the microbial growth curve as experimental degree of freedom. Using a D-optimal design criterion, it could be shown that the optimal sampling times were concentrated in four time periods (initial, start and end of exponential growth, end of experiment), each providing maximum information on a particular parameter. Because the optimal experimental design requires a priori estimates of the parameters, the propagation of the parameter uncertainty into the experimental design was assessed with a Monte Carlo simulation. In this way, 95\% confidence intervals could be established around the optimal sampling times to be used in the optimal experiment. Based on these intervals, a design was proposed and experimentally validated. The error on the parameter estimates was more than halved, their correlation diminished and the nonlinearity of the result improved.}

  abstract = {There are two sexes in C. elegans, hermaphrodite and male. While there are many sex-specific differences between males and hermaphrodites that affect most tissues, the basic body plan and many of its structures are identical. However, most structures required for mating or reproduction are sexually dimorphic and are generated by sex-specific cell lineages. Thus to understand cell fate specification in hermaphrodites, one must consider how the body plan, which is specified during embryogenesis, influences the fates individual cells. One possible mechanism may involve the asymmetric distribution of POP-1/Tcf, the sole C. elegans Tcf homolog, to anterior-posterior sister cells. Another mechanism that functions to specify cell fates along the anterior-posterior body axis in both hermaphrodites and males are the Hox genes. Since most of the cell fate specifications that occur in hermaphrodites also occur in males, the focus of this chapter will be on those that only occur in hermaphrodites. This will include the cell fate decisions that affect the HSN neurons, ventral hypodermal P cells, lateral hypodermal cells V5, V6, and T; as well as the mesodermal M, Z1, and Z4 cells and the intestinal cells. Both cell lineage-based and cell-signaling mechanisms of cell fate specification will be discussed. Only two direct targets of the sex determination pathway that influence cell fate specification to produce hermaphrodite-specific cell fates have been identified. Thus a major challenge will be to learn additional mechanisms by which the sex determination pathway interacts with signaling pathways and other cell fate specification genes to generate hermaphrodite-specific cell fates.},

The temporality of pigment formation during animal development, however, is more elusive. Here, we examine this temporality, focusing on yellow, a gene involved in the formation of black melanin. We generated a protein-tagged yellow allele in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, which allowed us to precisely describe Yellow expression pattern at the tissue and cellular levels throughout development. We found Yellow expressed in the pupal epidermis in patterns prefiguring black pigmentation. We also found Yellow expressed in a few central neurons from the second larval instar to adult stages, including a subset of neurons adjacent to the clock neurons marked by the gene Pdf. We then specifically examined the dynamics of Yellow expression domain and subcellular localization in relationship to pigment formation. In particular, we showed how a late step of re-internalization is regulated by the large low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein Megalin. Finally we suggest a new function for Yellow in the establishment of sharp pigmentation pattern boundaries, whereby this protein may assume a structural role, anchoring pigment deposits or pigmentation enzymes in the cuticle.},

  abstract = {The contemporary effective population size (Formula presented.) is important in many disciplines including population genetics, conservation science and pest management. One of the most popular methods of estimating this quantity uses temporal changes in allele frequency due to genetic drift. A significant assumption of the existing methods is the independence among loci while constructing confidence intervals (CI), which restricts the types of species or genetic data applicable to the methods. Although genetic linkage does not bias point (Formula presented.) estimates, applying these methods to linked loci can yield unreliable CI that are far too narrow. We extend the current methods to enable the use of many linked loci to produce precise contemporary (Formula presented.) estimates, while preserving the targeted CI width and coverage. This is achieved by deriving the covariance of changes in allele frequency at linked loci in the face of recombination and sampling errors, such that the extra sampling variance due to between-locus correlation is properly handled. Extensive simulations are used to verify the new method. We apply the method to two temporally spaced genomic data sets of Anopheles mosquitoes collected from a cluster of villages in Burkina Faso between 2012 and 2014. With over 33,000 linked loci considered, the (Formula presented.) estimate for Anopheles~coluzzii is 9,242 (95\% CI 5,702\textendash 24,282), and for Anopheles~gambiae it is 4,826 (95\% CI 3,602\textendash 7,353). \textcopyright{} 2021 The Authors.

In this first-in-human study, we aimed to investigate the safety, clinical activity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of tazemetostat, a first-in-class selective inhibitor of EZH2. Methods We did an open-label, multicentre, dose-escalation, phase 1 study using a 3\hphantom{,}+\hphantom{,}3 design with planned cohort expansion at the two highest doses below the maximally tolerated dose. The study was done at two centres in France: Institut Gustave Roussy (Villejuif, Val de Marne) and Institut Bergoni\'e (Bordeaux, Gironde). Eligible patients had relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma or an advanced solid tumour and were older than 18 years, with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and adequate end-organ function. Tazemetostat was administered orally from 100 mg twice daily to 1600 mg twice daily in 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint was to establish the maximum tolerated dose or recommended phase 2 dose of tazemetostat, as determined by dose-limiting toxicities, laboratory values, and other safety or pharmacokinetic measures in cycle one according to local investigator assessment. Safety was assessed in patients who received at least one dose of tazemetostat; antitumour activity was assessed in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01897571. The phase 1 part of the study is complete, and phase 2 is ongoing. Findings Between June 13, 2013, and Sept 21, 2016, 64 patients (21 with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and 43 with advanced solid tumours) received doses of tazemetostat. The most common treatment-related adverse events, regardless of attribution, were asthenia (21 [33\%] of 64 treatment-related events), anaemia (nine [14\%]), anorexia (four [6\%]), muscle spasms (nine [14\%]), nausea (13 [20\%]), and vomiting (six [9\%]), usually grade 1 or 2 in severity. A single dose-limiting toxicity of grade 4 thrombocytopenia was identified at the highest dose of 1600 mg twice daily. No treatment-related deaths occurred; seven (11\%) patients had non-treatment-related deaths (one at 200 mg twice daily, four at 400 mg twice daily, and two at 1600 mg twice daily). The recommended phase 2 dose was determined to be 800 mg twice daily. Durable objective responses, including complete responses, were observed in eight (38\%) of 21 patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and two (5\%) of 43 patients with solid tumours. Interpretation Tazemetostat showed a favourable safety profile and antitumour activity in patients with refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and advanced solid tumours, including epithelioid sarcoma. Further clinical investigation of tazemetostat monotherapy is ongoing in phase 2 studies in adults and a phase 1 study for children, which are currently enrolling patients who have B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and INI1-negative or SMARCA4-negative tumours.

  abstract = {When users on social media share content without considering its veracity, they may unwittingly be spreading misinformation. In this work, we investigate the design of lightweight interventions that nudge users to assess the accuracy of information as they share it. Such assessment may deter users from posting misinformation in the first place, and their assessments may also provide useful guidance to friends aiming to assess those posts themselves. In support of lightweight assessment, we first develop a taxonomy of the reasons why people believe a news claim is or is not true; this taxonomy yields a checklist that can be used at posting time. We conduct evaluations to demonstrate that the checklist is an accurate and comprehensive encapsulation of people's free-response rationales. In a second experiment, we study the effects of three behavioral nudges -- 1) checkboxes indicating whether headings are accurate, 2) tagging reasons (from our taxonomy) that a post is accurate via a checklist and 3) providing free-text rationales for why a headline is or is not accurate -- on people's intention of sharing the headline on social media. From an experiment with 1668 participants, we find that both providing accuracy assessment and rationale reduce the sharing of false content. They also reduce the sharing of true content, but to a lesser degree that yields an overall decrease in the fraction of shared content that is false. Our findings have implications for designing social media and news sharing platforms that draw from richer signals of content credibility contributed by users. In addition, our validated taxonomy can be used by platforms and researchers as a way to gather rationales in an easier fashion than free-response.},

Defects in these organelles cause inherited human disorders (ciliopathies) such as retinitis pigmentosa and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), frequently affecting many physiological and developmental processes across multiple organs. Cilium formation, maintenance and function depend on intracellular transport systems such as intraflagellar transport (IFT), which is driven by kinesin-2 and IFT-dynein motors and regulated by the Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) cargo-adaptor protein complex, or BBSome. To identify new cilium-associated genes, we employed the nematode C. elegans, where ciliogenesis occurs within a short timespan during late embryogenesis when most sensory neurons differentiate. Using whole-organism RNA-Seq libraries, we discovered a signature expression profile highly enriched for transcripts of known ciliary proteins, including FAM-161 (FAM161A orthologue), CCDC-104 (CCDC104), and RPI-1 (RP1/RP1L1), which we confirm are cilium-localised in worms. From a list of 185 candidate ciliary genes, we uncover orthologues of human MAP9, YAP, CCDC149, and RAB28 as conserved cilium-associated components. Further analyses of C. elegans RAB-28, recently associated with autosomal-recessive cone-rod dystrophy, reveal that this small GTPase is exclusively expressed in ciliated neurons where it dynamically associates with IFT trains. Whereas inactive GDP-bound RAB-28 displays no IFT movement and diffuse localisation, GTP-bound (activated) RAB-28 concentrates at the periciliary membrane in a BBSome-dependent manner and undergoes bidirectional IFT. Functional analyses reveal that whilst cilium structure, sensory function and IFT are seemingly normal in a rab-28 null allele, overexpression of predicted GDP or GTP locked variants of RAB-28 perturbs cilium and sensory pore morphogenesis and function. Collectively, our findings present a new approach for identifying ciliary proteins, and unveil RAB28, a GTPase most closely related to the BBS protein RABL4/IFT27, as an IFT-associated cargo with BBSome-dependent cell autonomous and non-autonomous functions at the ciliary base.},

  abstract = {Recently, researchers in several areas of ecology and evolution have begun to change the way in which they analyze data and make biological inferences. Rather than the traditional null hypothesis testing approach, they have adopted an approach called model selection, in which several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with data. Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark\textendash recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.},

Such sequences are very common in the human genome, and an important determinant of the specificity of gene expression is the cooperative binding of multiple TFs to closely located motifs4,5,6. However, interactions between DNA-bound TFs have not been systematically characterized. To identify TF pairs that bind cooperatively to DNA, and to characterize their spacing and orientation preferences, we have performed consecutive affinity-purification systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (CAP-SELEX) analysis of 9,400 TF\textendash TF\textendash DNA interactions. This analysis revealed 315 TF\textendash TF interactions recognizing 618 heterodimeric motifs, most of which have not been previously described. The observed cooperativity occurred promiscuously between TFs from diverse structural families. Structural analysis of the TF pairs, including a novel crystal structure of MEIS1 and DLX3 bound to their identified recognition site, revealed that the interactions between the TFs were predominantly mediated by DNA. Most TF pair sites identified involved a large overlap between individual TF recognition motifs, and resulted in recognition of composite sites that were markedly different from the individual TF's motifs. Together, our results indicate that the DNA molecule commonly plays an active role in cooperative interactions that define the gene regulatory lexicon.},

Researchers must balance various trade-offs associated with locus length and evolutionary rate among other factors. The most commonly used reduced representation data sets for phylogenomics are ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and Anchored Hybrid Enrichment (AHE). Here, we introduce Rapidly Evolving Long Exon Capture (RELEC), a new set of loci that targets single exons that are both rapidly evolving (evolutionary rate faster than RAG1) and relatively long in length (\&gt;1,500\,bp), while at the same time avoiding paralogy issues across amniotes. We compare the RELEC data set to UCEs and AHE in squamate reptiles by aligning and analyzing orthologous sequences from 17 squamate genomes, composed of 10 snakes and 7 lizards. The RELEC data set (179 loci) outperforms AHE and UCEs by maximizing per-locus genetic variation while maintaining presence and orthology across a range of evolutionary scales. RELEC markers show higher phylogenetic informativeness than UCE and AHE loci, and RELEC gene trees show greater similarity to the species tree than AHE or UCE gene trees. Furthermore, with fewer loci, RELEC remains computationally tractable for full Bayesian coalescent species tree analyses. We contrast RELEC to and discuss important aspects of comparable methods, and demonstrate how RELEC may be the most effective set of loci for resolving difficult nodes and rapid radiations. We provide several resources for capturing or extracting RELEC loci from other amniote groups.},

  abstract = {Estimating recent effective population size is of great importance in characterizing and predicting the evolution of natural populations. Methods based on nucleotide diversity may underestimate current day effective population sizes due to historical bottlenecks, whereas methods that reconstruct demographic history typically only detect long-term variations. However, soft selective sweeps, which leave a fingerprint of mutational history by recurrent mutations on independent haplotype backgrounds, holds promise of an estimate more representative of recent population history. Here, we present a simple and robust method of estimation based only on knowledge of the number of independent recurrent origins and the current frequency of the beneficial allele in a population sample, independent of the strength of selection and age of the mutation. Using a forward-time theoretical framework, we show the mean number of origins is a function of \texttheta =2N{$\mu$} and current allele frequency, through a simple equation, and the distribution is approximately Poisson. This estimate is robust to whether mutants preexisted before selection arose and is equally accurate for diploid populations with incomplete dominance. For fast (e.g., seasonal) demographic changes compared with time scale for fixation of the mutant allele, and for moderate peak-to-trough ratios, we show our constant population size estimate can be used to bound the maximum and minimum population size. Applied to the Vgsc gene of Anopheles gambiae, we estimate an effective population size of roughly 6\texttimes 107, and including seasonal demographic oscillations, a minimum effective population size \&gt;3\texttimes 107, and a maximum \&lt;6\texttimes 109, suggesting a mean {$\sim$}109.},

This indirect effect is referred to as ``genetic nurture.'' Kong et al. used data from genome-wide association studies of educational attainment to construct polygenic scores for parents that only considered the nontransmitted alleles (see the Perspective by Koellinger and Harden). The findings suggest that genetic nurture is ultimately due to genetic variation in the population and is mediated by the environment that parents create for their children. Science, this issue p. 424; see also p. 386 Sequence variants in the parental genomes that are not transmitted to a child (the proband) are often ignored in genetic studies. Here we show that nontransmitted alleles can affect a child through their impacts on the parents and other relatives, a phenomenon we call ``genetic nurture.'' Using results from a meta-analysis of educational attainment, we find that the polygenic score computed for the nontransmitted alleles of 21,637 probands with at least one parent genotyped has an estimated effect on the educational attainment of the proband that is 29.9\% (P = 1.6 \texttimes{} 10-14) of that of the transmitted polygenic score. Genetic nurturing effects of this polygenic score extend to other traits. Paternal and maternal polygenic scores have similar effects on educational attainment, but mothers contribute more than fathers to nutrition- and heath-related traits. Behavioral genetics can transmit an environmental effect from parents and other related caregivers to their children.

  abstract = {DNA sequence alignment is a prerequisite to virtually all comparative genomic analyses, including the identification of conserved sequence motifs, estimation of evolutionary divergence between sequences, and inference of historical relationships among genes and species. While it is mere common sense that inaccuracies in multiple sequence alignments can have detrimental effects on downstream analyses, it is important to know the extent to which the inferences drawn from these alignments are robust to errors and biases inherent in all sequence alignments. A survey of investigations into strengths and weaknesses of sequence alignments reveals, as expected, that alignment quality is generally poor for two distantly related sequences and can often be improved by adding additional sequences as stepping stones between distantly related species. Errors in sequence alignment are also found to have a significant negative effect on subsequent inference of sequence divergence, phylogenetic trees, and conserved motifs. However, our understanding of alignment biases remains rudimentary, and sequence alignment procedures continue to be used somewhat like benign formatting operations to make sequences equal in length. Because of the central role these alignments now play in our endeavors to establish the tree of life and to identify important parts of genomes through evolutionary functional genomics, we see a need for increased community effort to investigate influences of alignment bias on the accuracy of large-scale comparative genomics.},

We have recently described an RNA-based method, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), for targeted silencing of transcription in bacteria and human cells. The CRISPRi system is derived from the Streptococcus pyogenes CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats) pathway, requiring only the coexpression of a catalytically inactive Cas9 protein and a customizable single guide RNA (sgRNA). The Cas9-sgRNA complex binds to DNA elements complementary to the sgRNA and causes a steric block that halts transcript elongation by RNA polymerase, resulting in the repression of the target gene. Here we provide a protocol for the design, construction and expression of customized sgRNAs for transcriptional repression of any gene of interest. We also provide details for testing the repression activity of CRISPRi using quantitative fluorescence assays and native elongating transcript sequencing. CRISPRi provides a simplified approach for rapid gene repression within 1\textendash 2 weeks. The method can also be adapted for high-throughput interrogation of genome-wide gene functions and genetic interactions, thus providing a complementary approach to RNA interference, which can be used in a wider variety of organisms.},

We discuss the evidence from retrospective epidemiologic studies and from large randomized controlled trials showing the benefits of {$\omega$}-3 PUFA, specifically EPA and DHA, in primary and secondary CV prevention and provide insight into potential mechanisms of these observed benefits. The target EPA + DHA consumption should be at least 500 mg/day for individuals without underlying overt CV disease and at least 800 to 1,000 mg/day for individuals with known coronary heart disease and HF. Further studies are needed to determine optimal dosing and the relative ratio of DHA and EPA {$\omega$}-3 PUFA that provides maximal cardioprotection in those at risk of CV disease as well in the treatment of atherosclerotic, arrhythmic, and primary myocardial disorders.},

Cases of convergent adaptation inform our ideas about the ecological and molecular basis of adaptation. In judging the degree to which putative cases of convergent adaptation provide an independent replication of the process of adaptation, it is necessary to establish the degree to which the evolutionary change is unexpected under null models and to show that selection has repeatedly, independently driven these changes. Here, we discuss the issues that arise from these questions particularly for closely related populations, where gene flow and standing variation add additional layers of complexity. We outline a conceptual framework to guide intuition as to the extent to which evolutionary change represents the independent gain of information owing to selection and show that this is a measure of how surprised we should be by convergence. Additionally, we summarize the ways population and quantitative genetics and genomics may help us address questions related to convergent adaptation, as well as open new questions and avenues of research.

Here, we examined the endogenous ZRS in mice, using genome editing to establish the relationship between enhancer composition and embryonic phenotype. We show that enhancer activity is a consolidation of distinct activity domains. Spatial restriction of Shh expression is mediated by a discrete repressor module, whereas levels of gene expression are controlled by large overlapping domains containing varying numbers of HOXD binding sites. The number of HOXD binding sites regulates expression levels incrementally. Substantial portions of conserved sequence are dispensable, indicating the presence of sequence redundancy. We propose a collective model for enhancer activity in which function is an integration of discrete expression activities and redundant components that drive robust expression.},

We demonstrate that MYC, miR\textendash 17\textendash 5p, and miR\textendash 20a are up-regulated by CCAT2 through TCF7L2-mediated transcriptional regulation. We further identify the physical interaction between CCAT2 and TCF7L2 resulting in an enhancement of WNT signaling activity. We show that CCAT2 is itself a WNT downstream target, which suggests the existence of a feedback loop. Finally, we demonstrate that the SNP status affects CCAT2 expression and the risk allele G produces more CCAT2 transcript. Our results support a new mechanism of MYC and WNT regulation by the novel lncRNA CCAT2 in colorectal cancer pathogenesis, and provide an alternative explanation of the SNP-conferred cancer risk.},

Although there is a widespread perception that environmental influences on the epigenome are pervasive and profound, there has been little evidence to date in humans with respect to environmental factors that are biologically distal. Here we provide evidence on the associations between epigenetic modifications\textemdash in our case, CpG methylation\textemdash and educational attainment (EA), a biologically distal environmental factor that is arguably among the most important life-shaping experiences for individuals. Specifically, we report the results of an epigenome-wide association study meta-analysis of EA based on data from 27 cohort studies with a total of 10\,767 individuals. We find nine CpG probes significantly associated with EA. However, robustness analyses show that all nine probes have previously been found to be associated with smoking. Only two associations remain when we perform a sensitivity analysis in the subset of never-smokers, and these two probes are known to be strongly associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy, and thus their association with EA could be due to correlation between EA and maternal smoking. Moreover, the effect sizes of the associations with EA are far smaller than the known associations with the biologically proximal environmental factors alcohol consumption, body mass index, smoking and maternal smoking during pregnancy. Follow-up analyses that combine the effects of many probes also point to small methylation associations with EA that are highly correlated with the combined effects of smoking. If our findings regarding EA can be generalized to other biologically distal environmental factors, then they cast doubt on the hypothesis that such factors have large effects on the epigenome.},

We investigate the predictivity of geographic patterns of genetic variation based on geographic and environmental marginality using published genetic diversity data for 40 species (insects, plants, birds, mammals, worms). Only about half of species showed positive relationships between geographic and environmental marginality. Three analyses (sign test, multiple linear regression, and meta-analysis of correlation effect sizes) showed a negative relationship between genetic diversity and distance to environmental niche centroid, but no consistent relationship of genetic diversity with distance to geographic range center.},

  abstract = {The cilium both releases and binds to extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs may be used by cells as a form of intercellular communication and mediate a broad range of physiological and pathological processes. The mammalian polycystins (PCs) localize to cilia, as well as to urinary EVs released from renal epithelial cells. PC ciliary trafficking defects may be an underlying cause of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD), and ciliary\textendash EV interactions have been proposed to play a central role in the biology of PKD. In Caenorhabditis elegans and mammals, PC1 and PC2 act in the same genetic pathway, act in a sensory capacity, localize to cilia, and are contained in secreted EVs, suggesting ancient conservation. However, the relationship between cilia and EVs and the mechanisms generating PC-containing EVs remain an enigma. In a forward genetic screen for regulators of C. elegans PKD-2 ciliary localization, we identified CIL-7, a myristoylated protein that regulates EV biogenesis.

  abstract = {The cilium both releases and binds to extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs may be used by cells as a form of intercellular communication and mediate a broad range of physiological and pathological processes. The mammalian polycystins (PCs) localize to cilia, as well as to urinary EVs released from renal epithelial cells. PC ciliary trafficking defects may be an underlying cause of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD), and ciliary\textendash EV interactions have been proposed to play a central role in the biology of PKD. In Caenorhabditis elegans and mammals, PC1 and PC2 act in the same genetic pathway, act in a sensory capacity, localize to cilia, and are contained in secreted EVs, suggesting ancient conservation. However, the relationship between cilia and EVs and the mechanisms generating PC-containing EVs remain an enigma. In a forward genetic screen for regulators of C. elegans PKD-2 ciliary localization, we identified CIL-7, a myristoylated protein that regulates EV biogenesis. Loss of CIL-7 results in male mating behavioral defects, excessive accumulation of EVs in the lumen of the cephalic sensory organ, and failure to release PKD-2::GFP-containing EVs to the environment. Fatty acylation, such as myristoylation and palmitoylation, targets proteins to cilia and flagella. The CIL-7 myristoylation motif is essential for CIL-7 function and for targeting CIL-7 to EVs.

Anterior definitive endoderm (ADE) subpopulations identified by CD177 and CD275 show inverse activation of canonical and noncanonical WNT signaling. CD177+ ADE expresses and synthesizes the secreted WNT, NODAL and BMP antagonist CERBERUS1 and is specified toward the pancreatic fate. CD275+ ADE receives canonical Wnt signaling and is specified toward the liver fate. Isolated CD177+ ADE differentiates more homogeneously into pancreatic progenitors and into more functionally mature and glucose-responsive {$\beta$}-like cells in vitro compared with cells from unsorted differentiation cultures.},

  abstract = {Observational knowledge of the epidemic intensity, defined as the number of deaths divided by global population and epidemic duration, and of the rate of emergence of infectious disease outbreaks is necessary to test theory and models and to inform public health risk assessment by quantifying the probability of extreme pandemics such as COVID-19. Despite its significance, assembling and analyzing a comprehensive global historical record spanning a variety of diseases remains an unexplored task. A global dataset of historical epidemics from 1600 to present is here compiled and examined using novel statistical methods to estimate the yearly probability of occurrence of extreme epidemics. Historical observations covering four orders of magnitude of epidemic intensity follow a common probability distribution with a slowly decaying power-law tail (generalized Pareto distribution, asymptotic exponent = -0.71). The yearly number of epidemics varies ninefold and shows systematic trends. Yearly occurrence probabilities of extreme epidemics, Py, vary widely: Py of an event with the intensity of the ``Spanish influenza'' (1918 to 1920) varies between 0.27 and 1.9\% from 1600 to present, while its mean recurrence time today is 400 y (95\% CI: 332 to 489 y). The slow decay of probability with epidemic intensity implies that extreme epidemics are relatively likely, a property previously undetected due to short observational records and stationary analysis methods. Using recent estimates of the rate of increase in disease emergence from zoonotic reservoirs associated with environmental change, we estimate that the yearly probability of occurrence of extreme epidemics can increase up to threefold in the coming decades.},

Here, we show how the age of rare variants can be estimated from patterns of haplotype sharing and how these ages can be related to historical relationships between populations. We investigate the distribution of the age of variants occurring exactly twice ( variants) in a worldwide sample sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project, revealing enormous variation across populations. The median age of haplotypes carrying variants is 50 to 160 generations across populations within Europe or Asia, and 170 to 320 generations within Africa. Haplotypes shared between continents are much older with median ages for haplotypes shared between Europe and Asia ranging from 320 to 670 generations. The distribution of the ages of haplotypes is informative about their demography, revealing recent bottlenecks, ancient splits, and more modern connections between populations. We see the effect of selection in the observation that functional variants are significantly younger than nonfunctional variants of the same frequency. This approach is relatively insensitive to mutation rate and complements other nonparametric methods for demographic inference.},

Here we find that when activated G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) fail to undergo BBSome-mediated retrieval from cilia back into the cell, they concentrate into membranous buds at the tips of cilia before release into extracellular vesicles named ectosomes. Unexpectedly, actin and the actin regulators drebrin and myosin 6 mediate ectosome release from the tip of cilia. Mirroring signal-dependent retrieval, signal-dependent ectocytosis is a selective and effective process that removes activated signaling molecules from cilia. Congruently, ectocytosis compensates for BBSome defects as ectocytic removal of GPR161, a negative regulator of Hedgehog signaling, permits the appropriate transduction of Hedgehog signals in Bbs mutants. Finally, ciliary receptors that lack retrieval determinants such as the anorexigenic GPCR NPY2R undergo signal-dependent ectocytosis in wild-type cells. Our data show that signal-dependent ectocytosis regulates ciliary signaling in physiological and pathological contexts.,},

Among the most important factors that are responsible for this progress are the development of new statistical methods and advances in computational technology. In particular, phylogenetic analysis of DNA or protein sequences has become a powerful tool for studying molecular evolution. Along with this developing technology, the application of the new statistical and computational methods has become more complicated and there is no comprehensive volume that treats these methods in depth. Molecular Evolution and Phylogenetics fills this gap and present various statistical methods that are easily accessible to general biologists as well as biochemists, bioinformatists and graduate students. The text covers measurement of sequence divergence, construction of phylogenetic trees, statistical tests for detection of positive Darwinian selection, inference of ancestral amino acid sequences, construction of linearized trees, and analysis of allele frequency data. Emphasis is given to practical methods of data analysis, and methods can be learned by working through numerical examples using the computer program MEGA2 that is provided.},

A model is presented which outlines the various important interactions of C. jejuni with the intestinal epithelium, and we discuss the pro's and con's for the ``zipper'' over the ``trigger'' mechanism of invasion. Future work should clarify the contradictory role of some previously identified factors, and should identify and characterize novel virulence determinants, which are crucial to provide fresh insights into the diversity of strategies employed by this pathogen to cause disease.},

Here we report the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for educational attainment that extends our earlier discovery sample1,2 of 101,069 individuals to 293,723 individuals, and a replication study in an independent sample of 111,349 individuals from the UK Biobank. We identify 74 genome-wide significant loci associated with the number of years of schooling completed. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with educational attainment are disproportionately found in genomic regions regulating gene expression in the fetal brain. Candidate genes are preferentially expressed in neural tissue, especially during the prenatal period, and enriched for biological pathways involved in neural development. Our findings demonstrate that, even for a behavioural phenotype that is mostly environmentally determined, a well-powered GWAS identifies replicable associated genetic variants that suggest biologically relevant pathways. Because educational attainment is measured in large numbers of individuals, it will continue to be useful as a proxy phenotype in efforts to characterize the genetic influences of related phenotypes, including cognition and neuropsychiatric diseases.},

Several haplotype-based estimators exist for inferring the age of segregating beneficial mutations. Here, we develop an approximate Bayesian-based approach that rather estimates these parameters for fixed beneficial mutations in single populations. We integrate a range of existing diversity, site frequency spectrum, haplotype- and linkage disequilibrium-based summary statistics. We show that for strong selective sweeps on de novo mutations the method can estimate allele age and selection strength even in nonequilibrium demographic scenarios. We extend our approach to models of selection on standing variation, and co-infer the frequency at which selection began to act upon the mutation. Finally, we apply our method to estimate the age and selection strength of a previously identified mutation underpinning cryptic colour adaptation in a wild deer mouse population, and compare our findings with previously published estimates as well as with geological data pertaining to the presumed shift in selective pressure.},

In the present study we investigated the sensitivity of size-based subpopulations of extracellular vesicles to different concentrations of detergents including sodium dodecyl sulphate, Triton X-100, Tween 20 and deoxycholate. We determined the required detergent concentration that lysed each of the vesicle subpopulations secreted by Jurkat, THP-1, MiaPaCa and U937 human cell lines. We characterized the vesicles by tunable resistive pulse sensing, flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy. Microvesicles and apoptotic bodies were found to be more sensitive to detergent lysis than exosomes. Furthermore, we found evidence that sodium dodecyl sulphate and Triton X-100 were more effective in vesicle lysis at low concentrations than deoxycholate or Tween 20. Taken together, our data suggest that a combination of differential detergent lysis with tunable resistive pulse sensing or flow cytometry may prove useful for simple and fast differentiation between exosomes and other extracellular vesicle subpopulations as well as between vesicular and non-vesicular structures.},

  abstract = {In Drosophila, normal female meiosis arrests at metaphase I. After meiotic arrest is released by egg activation, the two meiotic divisions are rapidly completed, even in unfertilized eggs. Since little is known about the regulation of the meiotic cell cycle after the meiotic arrest, we screened for mutants that arrest in meiosis. Here we describe the phenotype of eggs laid by sterile mothers mutant for either grauzone or cortex. These eggs arrest in metaphase of meiosis II, and although they can enter into an aberrant anaphase II, they never exit meiosis. Prolonged sister-chromatid cohesion is not the cause of this arrest, since a premature release of sister cohesion does not rescue the meiotic arrest of cortex eggs. Aberrant chromosome segregation at meiosis I was the earliest observable defect, suggesting that grauzone and cortex are first required immediately after egg activation. The cortical microtubules are also defective, remaining in a pre-activated state in activated mutant eggs. The mutations had no observable effect on either male meiosis or mitosis. We believe these genes will provide insight into the developmental regulation of meiosis in a genetically tractable organism.},

  abstract = {Most of the models of microbial growth in food are Empirical algebraic, of which the Gompertz model is the most notable, Rate equations, mostly variants of the Verhulst's logistic model, or Population Dynamics models, which can be deterministic and continuous or stochastic and discrete. The models of the first two kinds only address net growth and hence cannot account for cell mortality that can occur at any phase of the growth. Almost invariably, several alternative models of all three types can describe the same set of experimental growth data. This lack of uniqueness is by itself a reason to question any mechanistic interpretation of growth parameters obtained by curve fitting alone. As argued, all the variants of the Verhulst's model, including the Baranyi-Roberts model, are empirical phenomenological models in a rate equation form. None provides any mechanistic insight or has inherent advantage over the others. In principle, models of all three kinds can predict non-isothermal growth patterns from isothermal data. Thus a modeler should choose the simplest and most convenient model for this purpose. There is no reason to assume that the dependence of the ``maximum specific growth rate'' on temperature, pH, water activity, or other factors follows the original or modified versions of the Arrhenius model, as the success of Ratkowsky's square root model testifies. Most sigmoid isothermal growth curves require three adjustable parameters for their mathematical description and growth curves showing a peak at least four. Although frequently observed, there is no theoretical reason that these growth parameters should always rise and fall in unison in response to changes in external conditions. Thus quantifying the effect of an environmental factor on microbial growth require that all the growth parameters are addressed, not just the ``maximum specific growth rate.'' Different methods to determine the ``lag time'' often yield different values, demonstrating that it is a poorly defined growth parameter. The combined effect of several factors, such as temperature and pH or aw, need not be ``multiplicative'' and therefore ought to be revealed experimentally. This might not be always feasible, but keeping the notion in mind will eliminate theoretical assumptions that are hard to confirm. Modern mathematical software allows to model growing or dying microbial populations where cell division and mortality occur simultaneously and can be used to explain how different growth patterns emerge. But at least in the near future, practical problems, like translating a varying temperature into a corresponding microbial growth curve, will be solved with empirical rate models, which despite not being ``mechanistic'' are perfectly suitable for this purpose.},

Their function is to mediate chromatin remodelling and modifications of the histone tails, therefore cooperating in establishing and maintaining transcriptional repression.The co-repressors nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR, also known as NCOR1) and silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT, also known as NCOR2) were originally isolated in 1995. Since then our view of the mechanism of action of co-repressors has progressively changed. Here, we describe how models of co-repressor function have evolved from a simple exchange between co-repressors and co-activators to a combinatorial model of co-repressor and co-activator action.Dismissal of co-repressors from regulated promoters is important to allow co-activator recruitment and is achieved through active steps of de-repression that involve post-translational modification of the co-repressors.Gene deletion studies of the NCoR and SMRT co-repressors in mouse models have indicated that they are specifically required for different developmental processes. NCoR is crucial in the development of erythrocytes and thymocytes, whereas SMRT is required for the development of the heart.Transcriptional repression mediated by NCoR and SMRT is crucial in the maintenance of embryonic neural stem cells, and their absence results in differentiation down glial or glial and neuronal pathways, respectively.},

The square root model has been shown to accurately predict temperature effects on the growth of several psychrotrophs in a number of dairy products. The formula can be applied for individual bacteria regardless of growth medium. This was not true for the Arrhenius equation. In this case, the apparent activation energy for growth ({$\mu$}) was dependent on source of isolate and growth medium. For isolates from pasteurized cream, {$\mu$} values were lower during growth in double cream than those obtained during growth in full-fat milk. This was due to shorter generation times at lower temperatures when these isolates were grown in double cream. Temperature-growth parameters were similar for bacteria grown in pasteurized as well as UHT products.},

  abstract = {The `centre\textendash periphery hypothesis' (CPH) is a long-standing postulate in ecology that states that genetic variation and demographic performance of a species decrease from the centre to the edge of its geographic range. This hypothesis is based on an assumed concordance between geographical peripherality and ecological marginality such that environmental conditions become harsher towards the limits of a species range. In this way, the CPH sets the stage for understanding the causes of distribution limits. To date, no study has examined conjointly the consistency of these postulates. In an extensive literature review we discuss the birth and development of the CPH and provide an assessment of the CPH by reviewing 248 empirical studies in the context of three main themes. First, a decrease in species occurrence towards their range limits was observed in 81\% of studies, while only 51\% demonstrated reduced abundance of individuals. A decline in genetic variation, increased differentiation among populations and higher rates of inbreeding were demonstrated by roughly one in two studies (47, 45 and 48\%, respectively). However, demographic rates, size and population performance less often followed CPH expectations (20\textendash 30\% of studies). We highlight the impact of important methodological, taxonomic, and biogeographical biases on such validation rates. Second, we found that geographic and ecological marginality gradients are not systematically concordant, which casts doubt on the reliability of a main assumption of the CPH. Finally, we attempt to disentangle the relative contribution of geographical, ecological and historical processes on the spatial distribution of genetic and demographic parameters. While ecological marginality gradients explain variation in species' demographic performance better than geographic gradients, contemporary and historical factors may contribute interactively to spatial patterns of genetic variation. We thereby propose a framework that integrates species' ecological niche characteristics together with current and past range structure to investigate spatial patterns of genetic and demographic variation across species ranges.},

  abstract = {Flow cytometry is a powerful method, which is widely used for high-throughput quantitative and qualitative analysis of cells. However, its straightforward applicability for extracellular vesicles (EVs) and mainly exosomes is hampered by several challenges, reflecting mostly the small size of these vesicles (exosomes: \textasciitilde 80\textendash 200 nm, microvesicles: \textasciitilde 200\textendash 1,000 nm), their polydispersity, and low refractive index. The current best and most widely used protocol for beads-free flow cytometry of exosomes uses ultracentrifugation (UC) coupled with floatation in sucrose gradient for their isolation, labeling with lipophilic dye PKH67 and antibodies, and an optimized version of commercial high-end cytometer for analysis. However, this approach requires an experienced flow cytometer operator capable of manual hardware adjustments and calibration of the cytometer. Here, we provide a novel and fast approach for quantification and characterization of both exosomes and microvesicles isolated from cell culture media as well as from more complex human samples (ascites of ovarian cancer patients) suitable for multiuser labs by using a flow cytometer especially designed for small particles, which can be used without adjustments prior to data acquisition. EVs can be fluorescently labeled with protein-(Carboxyfluoresceinsuccinimidyl ester, CFSE) and/or lipid- (FM) specific dyes, without the necessity of removing the unbound fluorescent dye by UC, which further facilitates and speeds up the characterization of microvesicles and exosomes using flow cytometry. In addition, double labeling with protein- and lipid-specific dyes enables separation of EVs from common contaminants of EV preparations, such as protein aggregates or micelles formed by unbound lipophilic styryl dyes, thus not leading to overestimation of EV numbers. Moreover, our protocol is compatible with antibody labeling using fluorescently conjugated primary antibodies. The presented methodology opens the possibility for routine quantification and characterization of EVs from various sources. Finally, it has the potential to bring a desired level of control into routine experiments and non-specialized labs, thanks to its simple bead-based standardization.},

Recently, roles for lncRNAs as drivers of tumor suppressive and oncogenic functions have appeared in prevalent cancer types, such as breast and prostate cancer. In this review, we highlight the emerging impact of ncRNAs in cancer research, with a particular focus on the mechanisms and functions of lncRNAs. Significance: lncRNAs represent the leading edge of cancer research. Their identity, function, and dysregulation in cancer are only beginning to be understood, and recent data suggest that they may serve as master drivers of carcinogenesis.

  abstract = {Understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms governing the evolution of morphology is a major challenge in biology. Because most animals share a conserved repertoire of body-building and -patterning genes, morphological diversity appears to evolve primarily through changes in the deployment of these genes during development. The complex expression patterns of developmentally regulated genes are typically controlled by numerous independent cis-regulatory elements (CREs). It has been proposed that morphological evolution relies predominantly on changes in the architecture of gene regulatory networks and in particular on functional changes within CREs. Here, we discuss recent experimental studies that support this hypothesis and reveal some unanticipated features of how regulatory evolution occurs. From this growing body of evidence, we identify three key operating principles underlying regulatory evolution, that is, how regulatory evolution: (i) uses available genetic components in the form of preexisting and active transcription factors and CREs to generate novelty; (ii) minimizes the penalty to overall fitness by introducing discrete changes in gene expression; and (iii) allows interactions to arise among any transcription factor and downstream CRE. These principles endow regulatory evolution with a vast creative potential that accounts for both relatively modest morphological differences among closely related species and more profound anatomical divergences among groups at higher taxonomical levels.},

Recently, hot-spot mutations of Ezh2 were identified in diffused large B-cell lymphomas and follicular lymphomas. To investigate if tumor growth is dependent on the enzymatic activity of Ezh2, we developed a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor, EI1, which inhibits the enzymatic activity of Ezh2 through direct binding to the enzyme and competing with the methyl group donor S-Adenosyl methionine. EI1-treated cells exhibit genome-wide loss of H3K27 methylation and activation of PRC2 target genes. Furthermore, inhibition of Ezh2 by EI1 in diffused large B-cell lymphomas cells carrying the Y641 mutations results in decreased proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. These results provide strong validation of Ezh2 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer.},

  abstract = {Advances in sequencing and genotyping technologies over the last decade have enabled geneticists to easily characterize genetic variation at the nucleotide level. Hundreds of genes harboring mutations associated with genetic disease have now been identified by positional cloning. Using variation at closely linked genetic markers, it is possible to predict the times in the past at which particular mutations arose. Such studies suggest that many of the rare mutations underlying human genetic disorders are relatively young. Studies of variation at genetic markers linked to particular mutations can provide insights into human geographic history, and historical patterns of natural selection and disease, that are not available from other sources. We review two approaches for estimating allele age using variation at linked genetic markers. A phylogenetic approach aims to reconstruct the gene tree underlying a sample of chromosomes carrying a particular mutation, obtaining a ``direct'' estimate of allele age from the age of the root of this tree. A population genetic approach relies on models of demography, mutation, and/or recombination to estimate allele age without explicitly reconstructing the gene tree. Phylogenetic methods are best suited for studies of ancient mutations, while population genetic methods are better suited for studies of recent mutations. Methods that rely on recombination to infer the ages of alleles can be fine-tuned by choosing linked markers at optimal map distances to maximize the information available about allele age. A limitation of methods that rely on recombination is the frequent lack of a fine-scale linkage map. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods for estimating allele age that rely on intensive numerical computation are described, as well as ``composite'' likelihood and moment-based methods that lead to simple estimators. The former provide more accurate estimates (particularly for large samples of chromosomes) and should be employed if computationally practical.

A phylogenetic correlation is expected; however, natural selection may force morphological evolution away from this expected correlation. To assess this relationship and the way it is modulated by selection, we investigated the radiation of the murine rodents, also called as Old World rats and mice. Regarding their diet, they are diversified as they include many omnivorous as well as specialist taxa. The size and shape of the mandible, a morphological character involved in the feeding process, was quantified and compared with an estimate of molecular divergence based on interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (IRBP) sequences. Size and shape of the mandible appeared to be related by an allometric relationship whatever the ecology of the taxa. Small size characterizes most murines, causing a dominance of low size distances; still, the frequency of important size differentiation increases with molecular distances. Regarding shape changes, the pattern is much contrasted between omnivores and specialists. A pattern of phenotypic drift characterizes the mandible evolution of taxa sharing an omnivorous diet. Little saturation occurs over more than 10 million years with regard to the shape of the mandible that appears as a valuable marker of phylogenetic history in this context. In contrast, important morphological distances can occur when specialist taxa are involved, even when the molecular divergence is small. Ecological specialization thus triggers an uncoupling of molecular and phenotypic evolution, and the departure from a phenotypic drift pattern.},

  abstract = {Genetic College Many genomic elements in humans are associated with behavior, including educational attainment. In a genome-wide association study including more than 100,000 samples, Rietveld et al. (p. 1467, published online 30 May; see the Perspective by Flint and Munaf\`o) looked for genes related to educational attainment in Caucasians. Small genetic effects at three loci appeared to impact educational attainment. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of educational attainment was conducted in a discovery sample of 101,069 individuals and a replication sample of 25,490. Three independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are genome-wide significant (rs9320913, rs11584700, rs4851266), and all three replicate. Estimated effects sizes are small (coefficient of determination R2 {$\approx$} 0.02\%), approximately 1 month of schooling per allele. A linear polygenic score from all measured SNPs accounts for {$\approx$}2\% of the variance in both educational attainment and cognitive function. Genes in the region of the loci have previously been associated with health, cognitive, and central nervous system phenotypes, and bioinformatics analyses suggest the involvement of the anterior caudate nucleus. These findings provide promising candidate SNPs for follow-up work, and our effect size estimates can anchor power analyses in social-science genetics. Three genetic loci are found to explain variation associated with educational achievement.

A combined approach of homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing revealed a homozygous nonsense mutation (c.565C{$>$}T [p.Glu189{${_\ast}$}]) in RAB28 in a German family with three siblings with arCRD. Another homozygous nonsense mutation (c.409C{$>$}T [p.Arg137{${_\ast}$}]) was identified in a family of Moroccan Jewish descent with two siblings affected by arCRD. All five affected individuals presented with hyperpigmentation in the macula, progressive loss of the visual acuity, atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium, and severely reduced cone and rod responses on the electroretinogram. RAB28 encodes a member of the Rab subfamily of the RAS-related small GTPases. Alternative RNA splicing yields three predicted protein isoforms with alternative C-termini, which are all truncated by the nonsense mutations identified in the arCRD families in this report. Opposed to other Rab GTPases that are generally geranylgeranylated, RAB28 is predicted to be farnesylated. Staining of rat retina showed localization of RAB28 to the basal body and the ciliary rootlet of the photoreceptors. Analogous to the function of other RAB family members, RAB28 might be involved in ciliary transport in photoreceptor cells. This study reveals a crucial role for RAB28 in photoreceptor function and suggests that mutations in other Rab proteins may also be associated with retinal dystrophies.},

The isolation and analysis of EV cargos from mammalian cell culture and liquid biopsysamples has become a powerful approach for uncovering the messages that are packaged into these organelles. However, this approach has not been tenable in invertebrate model systems due to lack of sufficient amounts of pure EVs. Here we report a robust and reproducible procedure to isolateEVs from \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans} with yields similar to those obtained from human cell culture. Through nanoparticle tracking, transmission electron microscopy, flow cytometry, mass spectrometry, RNAseq, and immunoaffinity analysis we provide the first ever detailed characterization of \emph{C. elegans} EV composition and demonstrate that \emph{C. elegans} EVs share fundamentally similar properties with their mammalian counterparts. These include vesicle size, enrichment for lipid rafts, and similar types of RNA and protein cargos. This ability of isolate pure EVs on ascale amenable to multiple types of downstream analyses permits, multi-omics characterization of EV cargos in an invertebrate model system.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The secretion of small membrane-bound vesicles into the external environment is a fundamental physiological process of all cells. These extracellular vesicles (EVs) function outside the cell to regulate global physiological processes by transferring proteins, nucleic acids, metabolites, and lipids between tissues. EVs reflect the physiological state of their cells of origin. EVs are implicated to have fundamental roles in virtually every aspect of human health. Thus, EV protein and genetic cargos are being increasingly analyzed for biomarkers of health and disease. However, the EV field still lacks a tractable invertebrate model system that permits the study of EV cargo composition. C. elegans is well suited for EV research because it actively secretes EVs outside of its body into its external environment, permitting facile isolation. This article provides all the necessary information for generating, purifying, and quantifying these environmentally secreted C. elegans EVs including how to work quantitatively with very large populations of age-synchronized worms, purifying EVs, and a flow cytometry protocol that directly measures the number of intact EVs in the purified sample. Thus, the large library of genetic reagents available for C. elegans research can be tapped into for investigating the impacts of genetic pathways and physiological processes on EV cargo composition.},

Open-source software is ideal for scientific endeavors because it can be freely inspected, modified, and redistributed; in particular, the open-software platform ImageJ has had a huge impact on the life sciences, and continues to do so. From its inception, ImageJ has grown significantly due largely to being freely available and its vibrant and helpful user community. Scientists as diverse as interested hobbyists, technical assistants, students, scientific staff, and advanced biology researchers use ImageJ on a daily basis, and exchange knowledge via its dedicated mailing list. Uses of ImageJ range from data visualization and teaching to advanced image processing and statistical analysis. The software's extensibility continues to attract biologists at all career stages as well as computer scientists who wish to effectively implement specific image-processing algorithms. In this review, we use the ImageJ project as a case study of how open-source software fosters its suites of software tools, making multitudes of image-analysis technology easily accessible to the scientific community. We specifically explore what makes ImageJ so popular, how it impacts the life sciences, how it inspires other projects, and how it is self-influenced by coevolving projects within the ImageJ ecosystem.

Despite their clinical potential, the lack of sensitive preparatory and analytical technologies for EVs poses a barrier to clinical translation. New analytical platforms including molecular ones are thus actively being developed to address these challenges. Recent advances in the field are expected to have far-reaching impact in both basic and translational studies. This article aims to present a comprehensive and critical overview of emerging analytical technologies for EV detection, and their clinical applications.},

  abstract = {Evidence supporting germline mediated epigenetic inheritance of environmentally induced traits has increasingly emerged over the past several years. Although the mechanisms underlying this inheritance remain unclear, recent findings suggest that parental gamete-borne epigenetic factors, particularly RNAs, affect post-fertilization and developmental gene regulation, ultimately leading to phenotypic appearance in the offspring. Complex processes involving gene expression and epigenetic regulation are considered to perpetuate across generations. In addition to transfer of germline factors, epigenetic inheritance via gametes also requires a mechanism whereby the information pertaining to the induced traits is communicated from soma to germline. Despite violating a century-old view in biology, this communication seems to play a role in transmission of environmental effects across generations. Circulating RNAs, especially those associated with extracellular vesicles like exosomes, are emerging as promising candidates that can transmit gene regulatory information in this direction. Cumulatively, these new observations provide a basis to integrate epigenetic inheritance. With significant implications in health, disease and ageing, the latter appears poised to revolutionize biology.},

  abstract = {Campylobacter jejuni is the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in humans, but relatively little is known about the global regulation of virulence factors during infection of chickens or humans. This study identified DNA supercoiling as playing a key role in regulating motility and flagellar protein production and found that this supercoiling-controlled regulon is induced by growth in chicken mucus. A direct correlation was observed between motility and resting DNA supercoiling levels in different strains of C. jejuni, and relaxation of DNA supercoiling resulted in decreased motility. Transcriptional analysis and Western immunoblotting revealed that a reduction in motility and DNA supercoiling affected the two-component regulatory system FlgRS and was associated with reduced FlgR expression, increased FlgS expression, and aberrant expression of flagellin subunits. Electron microscopy revealed that the flagellar structure remained intact. Growth in the presence of porcine mucin resulted in increased negative supercoiling, increased motility, increased FlgR expression, and reduced FlgS expression. Finally, this supercoiling-dependent regulon was shown to be induced by growth in chicken mucus, and the level of activation was dependent on the source of the mucus from within the chicken intestinal tract. In conclusion, this study reports for the first time the key role played by DNA supercoiling in regulating motility in C. jejuni and indicates that the induction of this supercoilinginduced regulon in response to mucus from different sources could play a critical role in regulating motility in vivo. IMPORTANCE Although Campylobacter jejuni is the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis, very little is understood about how this pathogen controls the expression of genes involved in causing disease. This study for the first time identifies DNA supercoiling as a key regulator of motility in C. jejuni, which is essential for both pathogenesis and colonization. Altering the level of DNA supercoiling results in changes in motility levels, as well as changes in the expression of genes involved in flagellar gene regulation. Furthermore, spontaneous clones of the organism with different motility profiles have altered DNA supercoiling levels. Finally, mucus was identified as a key stimulator of changes in DNA supercoiling, and it was shown that mucus from different sites in the chicken intestine induced different levels of DNA supercoiling. In conclusion, this study implicates DNA supercoiling as a key regulator of motility in C. jejuni in vivo during colonization of the mucus layer.},

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), particularly Lactobacillus plantarum, Weissella viridescens and Lactobacillus sakei, are the main spoilage bacteria of refrigerated, vacuum-packed meat products, stored in modified atmosphere, and their growth determines the shelf life length of these products. The objective of this study was to model the growth of L. plantarum, W. viridescens and L. sakei under different isothermal cultivation conditions and establish secondary models to describe the effect of temperature on the growth parameters of these bacteria. The LAB growth was evaluated in culture medium at temperatures of 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 30 \textordmasculine C. The fit of Baranyi and Roberts (BAR) and Gompertz (GO) primary models to the growth curves of LAB was compared by statistical indices, in which the BAR model showed slightly better fits to the experimental data. The BAR growth parameters were used to establish the secondary models, \textmu max and Nmax were established for the three LAB. The power model described the influence of temperature on the parameter {$\lambda$} for L. plantarum, and other bacteria showed no lag phase. The growth of LAB was strongly influenced by storage temperature and the obtained models allow predicting the growth of these bacteria within the temperature range from 4 to 30 \textordmasculine C.},

The 100th anniversary of the British Ecological Society in 2013 is an opportune moment to reflect on the current status of ecology as a science and look forward to high-light priorities for future work. To do this, we identified 100 important questions of fundamental importance in pure ecology. We elicited questions from ecologists working across a wide range of systems and disciplines. The 754 questions submitted (listed in the online appendix) from 388 participants were narrowed down to the final 100 through a process of discussion, rewording and repeated rounds of voting. This was done during a two-day workshop and thereafter. The questions reflect many of the important current conceptual and technical pre-occupations of ecology. For example, many questions concerned the dynamics of environmental change and complex ecosystem interactions, as well as the interaction between ecology and evolution. The questions reveal a dynamic science with novel subfields emerging. For example, a group of questions was dedicated to disease and micro-organisms and another on human impacts and global change reflecting the emergence of new subdisciplines that would not have been foreseen a few decades ago. The list also contained a number of questions that have perplexed ecologists for decades and are still seen as crucial to answer, such as the link between population dynamics and life-history evolution. Synthesis. These 100 questions identified reflect the state of ecology today. Using them as an agenda for further research would lead to a substantial enhancement in understanding of the discipline, with practical relevance for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem function.},

Human iPS cells were similar to human embryonic stem (ES) cells in morphology, proliferation, surface antigens, gene expression, epigenetic status of pluripotent cell-specific genes, and telomerase activity. Furthermore, these cells could differentiate into cell types of the three germ layers in vitro and in teratomas. These findings demonstrate that iPS cells can be generated from adult human fibroblasts.},

  abstract = {Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) such as exosomes are nanocarriers of proteins, RNAs and DNAs. Isolation of pure sEV populations remains challenging, with reports of protein and lipoprotein contaminants in the isolates. Cellular uptake \textendash{} a cornerstone for understanding exosome and sEV function \textendash{} is frequently examined using lipophilic dyes such as PKH67 or CellMask to label the vesicles. In this study, we investigated whether contaminants can confound the outcomes from sEV and exosomes uptake experiments. sEVs were isolated from blood plasma of fasted or non-fasted rats as well as from serum-supplemented or serum-free conditioned cell culture medium using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Eluent fractions were characterized using nanoparticle tracking, protein and triglyceride assays and immunoassays. SEC fractions were labelled with different lipophilic dyes and cellular uptake was quantified using endothelial cells or primary cardiomyocytes. We report co-isolation of sEVs with apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins. Cellular dye transfer did not correspond to sEV content of the SEC fractions, but was severely affected by lipoprotein and protein content. Overnight fasting of rats decreased lipoprotein content and also decreased dye transfer, while late, sEV-poor/protein-rich fractions demonstrated even greater dye transfer. The potential for dye transfer to occur in the complete absence of sEVs was clearly shown by experiments using staining of sEV-depleted serum or pure protein sample. In conclusion, proteins and lipoproteins can make a substantial contribution to transfer of lipophilic dyes to recipient cells. Considering the likelihood of contamination of sEV and exosome isolates, lipophilic dye staining experiments should be carefully controlled, and conclusions interpreted with caution.},

The possession and adaptation of these plasmids has shaped the current Shigella spp.Convergent evolution, through the acquisition of mobile elements and loss of gene function, enabled Shigella spp. to become restricted to humans and exquisitely adapted to interact with the human intestinal mucosa.The shift in dominance from Shigella flexneri to Shigella sonnei in economically transitioning nations warrants more in-depth studies of the evolution and epidemiology of these species.There is a correlation between the global dissemination of Shigella spp. clones and acquisition of resistance to multiple antimicrobials. An antimicrobial-resistance phenotype is likely to be advantageous for the bacteria, as it would promote post-symptomatic shedding by the host and would sustain short-term transmission.In comparison to S. sonnei and S. flexneri, comparatively little is currently understood about Shigella dysenteriae and Shigella boydii; this needs to be addressed to reveal the full evolutionary landscape of the genus.Future laboratory research should be combined with genomics to address the survival, transmission and evolution of Shigella spp. in the environment, specifically focusing on how the environmental lifestyle can affect disease epidemiology and global public health.},

  abstract = {The last decade has seen a sharp increase in the number of scientific publications describing physiological and pathological functions of extracellular vesicles (EVs), a collective term covering various subtypes of cell-released, membranous structures, called exosomes, microvesicles, microparticles, ectosomes, oncosomes, apoptotic bodies, and many other names. However, specific issues arise when working with these entities, whose size and amount often make them difficult to obtain as relatively pure preparations, and to characterize properly. The International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) proposed Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (``MISEV'') guidelines for the field in 2014. We now update these ``MISEV2014'' guidelines based on evolution of the collective knowledge in the last four years. An important point to consider is that ascribing a specific function to EVs in general, or to subtypes of EVs, requires reporting of specific information beyond mere description of function in a crude, potentially contaminated, and heterogeneous preparation. For example, claims that exosomes are endowed with exquisite and specific activities remain difficult to support experimentally, given our still limited knowledge of their specific molecular machineries of biogenesis and release, as compared with other biophysically similar EVs. The MISEV2018 guidelines include tables and outlines of suggested protocols and steps to follow to document specific EV-associated functional activities. Finally, a checklist is provided with summaries of key points.},

Here we present the first extensive map of human DHSs identified through genome-wide profiling in 125 diverse cell and tissue types. We identify {$\sim$}2.9 million DHSs that encompass virtually all known experimentally validated cis-regulatory sequences and expose a vast trove of novel elements, most with highly cell-selective regulation. Annotating these elements using ENCODE data reveals novel relationships between chromatin accessibility, transcription, DNA methylation and regulatory factor occupancy patterns. We connect {$\sim$}580,000 distal DHSs with their target promoters, revealing systematic pairing of different classes of distal DHSs and specific promoter types. Patterning of chromatin accessibility at many regulatory regions is organized with dozens to hundreds of co-activated elements, and the transcellular DNase I sensitivity pattern at a given region can predict cell-type-specific functional behaviours. The DHS landscape shows signatures of recent functional evolutionary constraint. However, the DHS compartment in pluripotent and immortalized cells exhibits higher mutation rates than that in highly differentiated cells, exposing an unexpected link between chromatin accessibility, proliferative potential and patterns of human variation.},

We find that rewarding priority of discovery causes populations to culturally evolve towards conducting research with smaller samples. This reduces research reliability and the information value of the average study. Increased start-up costs for setting up single studies and increased payoffs for secondary results (also known as scoop protection) attenuate the negative effects of competition. Furthermore, large rewards for negative results promote the evolution of smaller sample sizes. Our results confirm the logical coherence of scoop protection reforms at several journals. Our results also imply that reforms to increase scientific efficiency, such as rapid journal turnaround times, may produce collateral damage by incentivizing lower-quality research; in contrast, reforms that increase start-up costs, such as pre-registration and registered reports, may generate incentives for higher-quality research.},

While the amphids and phasmids are easy to stain, a subset of sensory neurons, the IL2 neurons, are difficult to stain reproducibly. Here we examined the conditions under which the IL2 neurons take up the lipophilic fluorescent dye DiI. We find that IL2 dye-filling depends on salt concentration, but not osmolarity. Low salt prior and during incubation is important for efficient dye uptake. Additional parameters that affect dye-filling are the speed of shaking during incubation and the addition of detergents. Our modified dye-filling procedure provides a reliable method to distinguish mutant alleles that stain amphids and phasmids, IL2 neurons, or both. An additional benefit is that it can also stain the excretory duct. The method allows genetic screens to be performed to identify mutants that selectively affect only one of the sensory structures or the excretory duct.},

  abstract = {cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) generate precise expression patterns by integrating numerous transcription factors (TFs). Surprisingly, CRMs that control essential gene patterns can differ greatly in conservation, suggesting distinct constraints on TF binding sites. Here, we show that a highly conserved Distal-less regulatory element (DCRE) that controls gene expression in leg precursor cells recruits multiple Hox, Extradenticle (Exd) and Homothorax (Hth) complexes to mediate dual outputs: thoracic activation and abdominal repression. Using reporter assays, we found that abdominal repression is particularly robust, as neither individual binding site mutations nor a DNA binding deficient Hth protein abolished cooperative DNA binding and in vivo repression. Moreover, a re-engineered DCRE containing a distinct configuration of Hox, Exd, and Hth sites also mediated abdominal Hox repression. However, the re-engineered DCRE failed to perform additional segment-specific functions such as thoracic activation. These findings are consistent with two emerging concepts in gene regulation: First, the abdominal Hox/Exd/Hth factors utilize protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions to form repression complexes on flexible combinations of sites, consistent with the TF collective model of CRM organization. Second, the conserved DCRE mediates multiple cell-type specific outputs, consistent with recent findings that pleiotropic CRMs are associated with conserved TF binding and added evolutionary constraints.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation is the most widely-studied epigenetic modification, playing a critical role in the regulation of gene expression. Dysregulation of DNA methylation is implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases. For example, aberrant DNA methylation in promoter regions of tumor-suppressor genes has been strongly associated with the development and progression of many different tumors. Accordingly, technologies designed to manipulate DNA methylation at specific genomic loci are very important, especially in the context of cancer therapy. Traditionally, epigenomic editing technologies have centered around zinc finger proteins (ZFP)- and transcription activator-like effector protein (TALE)-based targeting. More recently, however, the emergence of clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-deactivated Cas9 (dCas9)-based editing systems have shown to be a more specific and efficient method for the targeted manipulation of DNA methylation. Here, we describe the regulation of the DNA methylome, its significance in cancer and the current state of locus-specific editing technologies for altering DNA methylation.},

Epigenetic marks, including DNA methylation, histones, chromatin structure, and noncoding RNAs, are modified throughout life in response to environmental and behavioral influences. With each new generation, DNA methylation patterns are erased in gametes and reset after fertilization, probably to prevent these epigenetic marks from being transferred from parents to their offspring. However, some recent animal studies suggest an apparent resistance to complete erasure of epigenetic marks during early development, enabling transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. Whether there are similar mechanisms in humans remains unclear, with the exception of epigenetic imprinting. Nevertheless, a distinctly different mechanism\textemdash namely, intrauterine exposure to environmental stressors that may affect establishment of the newly composing epigenetic patterns after fertilization\textemdash is often confused with transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. In this review, we delineate the definition of and requirement for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, differentiate it from the consequences of intrauterine exposure, and discuss the available evidence in both animal models and humans.\textemdash Van Otterdijk, S.

Although echolocation is usually associated with bats, it is not characteristic of all bats. Most echolocating bats produce signals in the larynx, but within one family of mainly non-echolocating species (Pteropodidae), a few species use echolocation sounds produced by tongue clicks. Here we demonstrate, using data obtained from micro-computed tomography scans of 26 species (n = 35 fluid-preserved bats), that proximal articulation of the stylohyal bone (part of the mammalian hyoid apparatus) with the tympanic bone always distinguishes laryngeally echolocating bats from all other bats (that is, non-echolocating pteropodids and those that echolocate with tongue clicks). In laryngeally echolocating bats, the proximal end of the stylohyal bone directly articulates with the tympanic bone and is often fused with it. Previous research on the morphology of the stylohyal bone in the oldest known fossil bat (Onychonycteris finneyi) suggested that it did not echolocate, but our findings suggest that O. finneyi may have used laryngeal echolocation because its stylohyal bones may have articulated with its tympanic bones. The present findings reopen basic questions about the timing and the origin of flight and echolocation in the early evolution of bats. Our data also provide an independent anatomical character by which to distinguish laryngeally echolocating bats from other bats.},

  abstract = {Cilia are sensory organelles that protrude from cell surfaces to monitor the surrounding environment. In addition to its role as sensory receiver, the cilium also releases extracellular vesicles (EVs). The release of sub-micron sized EVs is a conserved form of intercellular communication used by all three kingdoms of life. These extracellular organelles play important roles in both short and long range signaling between donor and target cells and may coordinate systemic responses within an organism in normal and diseased states. EV shedding from ciliated cells and EV\textendash cilia interactions are evolutionarily conserved phenomena, yet remarkably little is known about the relationship between the cilia and EVs and the fundamental biology of EVs. Studies in the model organisms Chlamydomonas and Caenorhabditis elegans have begun to shed light on ciliary EVs. Chlamydomonas EVs are shed from tips of flagella and are bioactive. Caenorhabditis elegans EVs are shed and released by ciliated sensory neurons in an intraflagellar transport-dependent manner. Caenorhabditis elegans EVs play a role in modulating animal-to-animal communication, and this EV bioactivity is dependent on EV cargo content. Some ciliary pathologies, or ciliopathies, are associated with abnormal EV shedding or with abnormal cilia\textendash EV interactions. Until the 21st century, both cilia and EVs were ignored as vestigial or cellular junk. As research interest in these two organelles continues to gain momentum, we envision a new field of cell biology emerging. Here, we propose that the cilium is a dedicated organelle for EV biogenesis and EV reception. We will also discuss possible mechanisms by which EVs exert bioactivity and explain how what is learned in model organisms regarding EV biogenesis and function may provide insight to human ciliopathies.},

Many fundamental aspects of ECV biogenesis and signaling have yet to be determined, with ECV detection being a challenge and obstacle due to their small size (100nm). We developed an in vivo system to visualize the dynamic release of GFP-labeled ECVs. We show here that specific Caenorhabdidits elegans ciliated sensory neurons shed and release ECVs containing GFP-tagged polycystins LOV-1 and PKD-2. These ECVs are also abundant in the lumen surrounding the cilium. Electron tomography and genetic analysis indicate that ECV biogenesis occurs via budding from the plasma membrane at the ciliary base and not via fusion of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Intraflagellar transport (IFT) and kinesin-3 KLP-6 are required for environmental release of PKD-2::GFP-containing ECVs. ECVs isolated from wild-type animals induce male tail chasing behavior, while ECVs isolated from klp-6 animals and lacking PKD-2::GFP do not. We conclude that environmentally released ECVs play a role in animal communication and mating related behaviors.},

  abstract = {Ciliopathies comprise a group of disorders associated with genetic mutations encoding defective proteins, which result in either abnormal formation or function of cilia. As cilia are a component of almost all vertebrate cells, cilia dysfunction can manifest as a constellation of features that include characteristically, retinal degeneration, renal disease and cerebral anomalies. Additional manifestations include congenital fibrocystic diseases of the liver, diabetes, obesity and skeletal dysplasias. Ciliopathic features have been associated with mutations in over 40 genes to date. However, with over 1,000 polypeptides currently identified within the ciliary proteome, several other disorders associated with this constellation of clinical features will likely be ascribed to mutations in other ciliary genes. The mechanisms underlying many of the disease phenotypes associated with ciliary dysfunction have yet to be fully elucidated. Several elegant studies have crucially demonstrated the dynamic ciliary localisation of components of the Hedgehog and Wnt signalling pathways during signal transduction. Given the critical role of the cilium in transducing ``outside-in'' signals, it is not surprising therefore, that the disease phenotypes consequent to ciliary dysfunction are a manifestation of aberrant signal transduction. Further investigation is now needed to explore the developmental and physiological roles of aberrant signal transduction in the manifestation of ciliopathy phenotypes. Utilisation of conditional and inducible murine models to delete or overexpress individual ciliary genes in a spatiotemporal and organ/cell-specific manner should help clarify some of the functional roles of ciliary proteins in the manifestation of phenotypic features.},

Whilst high resolution flow cytometry promises detection of the full EV diameter range, standardization of light scattering and fluorescence data between different flow cytometers remains an problem. In this mini review, we will discuss the advances in high-resolution flow cytometry development and future direction of EV scatter and fluorescence standardization.

A polygenic score (PGS) derived from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can be used to test for the presence of parental influence that controls for genetic variants shared across generations. We use a PGS for educational attainment (EA3; N\,{$\approx$}\,750 thousand) to predict offspring years of education in a sample of 2517 twins and both parents. We find that within families, the dizygotic twin with the higher PGS is more likely to attain higher education (unstandardized {$\beta$}\,=\,0.32; p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Additionally, however, we find an effect of parental genotype on offspring outcome that is independent of the offspring's own genotype; this raises the variance explained in offspring years of education from 9.3 to 11.1\% ({$\increment$}R2\,=\,0.018, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Controlling for parental IQ or socioeconomic status substantially attenuated or eliminated this effect of parental genotype. These findings suggest a role of environmental factors affected by heritable characteristics of the parents in fostering offspring years of education.},

Membrane vesicles of this kind, termed exosomes and ectosomes, are the result of active processes and have been shown to carry a wide array of biological effector molecules that can play roles in cell-to-cell communication and remodeling of the extracellular space. Degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) through the regulated release of proteolytic enzymes is a key process for development, morphogenesis, and cell migration in animal and plant cells. Here we show that the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas achieves the timely degradation of its mother cell wall, a type of ECM, through the budding of ectosomes directly from the membranes of its flagella. Using a combination of immunoelectron microscopy, immunofluorescence microscopy, and functional analysis, we demonstrate that these vesicles, which we term ciliary ectosomes, act as carriers of the proteolytic enzyme necessary for the liberation of daughter cells following mitosis. Chlamydomonas has proven to be the key unicellular model for the highly conserved mechanisms of mammalian cilia, and our results suggest that cilia may be an underappreciated source of bioactive, extracellular membrane vesicles.},

Theory in movement ecology suggests that the density and mobility of targeted foods should predict spatial behaviour and that strong gender differences should arise in a hunter-gatherer context. As predicted, we find that men walked further per day, explored more land, followed more sinuous paths and were more likely to be alone. These data are consistent with the ecology of male- and female-targeted foods and suggest that male landscape use is more navigationally challenging in this hunter-gatherer context. Comparisons of Hadza space use with space use data available for non-human primates suggest that the sexual division of labour likely co-evolved with increased sex differences in spatial behaviour and landscape use.},

These are summarized into six technical and six fundamental challenges, which underlie the combined need to intensify research on the determinants of ecological predictability, including species traits and data quality, and develop best practices for transferring models. Of high importance is the identification of a widely applicable set of transferability metrics, with appropriate tools to quantify the sources and impacts of prediction uncertainty under novel conditions.},

  abstract = {Vavilovian mimicry is an evolutionary process by which weeds evolve to resemble domesticated crop plants and is thought to be the result of unintentional selection by humans. Unravelling its molecular mechanisms will extend our knowledge of mimicry and contribute to our understanding of the origin and evolution of agricultural weeds, an important component of crop biology. To this end, we compared mimetic and non-mimetic populations of Echinochloa crus-galli from the Yangtze River basin phenotypically and by genome resequencing, and we show that this weed in rice paddies has evolved a small tiller angle, allowing it to phenocopy cultivated rice at the seedling stage. We demonstrate that mimetic lines evolved from the non-mimetic population as recently as 1,000\,yr ago and were subject to a genetic bottleneck, and that genomic regions containing 87 putative plant architecture-related genes (including LAZY1, a key gene controlling plant tiller angle) were under selection during the mimicry process. Our data provide genome-level evidence for the action of human selection on Vavilovian mimicry.},

  abstract = {Cell isolation and culture are essential tools for the study of cell function. Isolated cells grown under controlled conditions can be manipulated and imaged at a level of resolution that is not possible in whole animals or even tissue explants. Recent advances have allowed for large-scale isolation and culture of primary C. elegans cells from both embryos and all four larval stages. Isolated cells can be used for single-cell profiling, electrophysiology, and high-resolution microscopy to assay cell autonomous development and behavior. This chapter describes protocols for the isolation and culture of C. elegans embryonic and larval stage cells. Our protocols describe isolation of embryonic and L1 stage cells from nematodes grown on high-density NA22 bacterial plates and isolation of L2 through L4 stage cells from nematodes grown in axenic liquid culture. Both embryonic and larval cells can be isolated from nematode populations within 3 hours and can be cultured for several days. A primer on sterile cell culture techniques is given in the appendices.},

  abstract = {1. While teaching statistics to ecologists, the lead authors of this paper have noticed common statistical problems. If a random sample of their work (including scientific papers) produced before doing these courses were selected, half would probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques employed. 2. Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.},

They were compared statistically by using the model of Schnute, which is a comprehensive model, encompassing all other models. The t test and the F test were used. With the t test, confidence intervals for parameters can be calculated and can be used to distinguish between models. In the F test, the lack of fit of the models is compared with the measuring error. Moreover, the models were compared with respect to their ease of use. All sigmoidal functions were modified so that they contained biologically relevant parameters. The models of Richards, Schnute, and Stannard appeared to be basically the same equation. In the cases tested, the modified Gompertz equation was statistically sufficient to describe the growth data of Lactobacillus plantarum and was easy to use.},
