## High Performance Computing
This subdirectory includes the work completed for the HPC week in the CMEE MSc course, taught by James Rosindell. Scripts are written in bash (for the UNIX HPC cluster) and R version 4.1.1. The main script files can be found in code/etm21. The best method for testing the functions is to use the source command in an R environment. Topics explored include the ecological neutral model and fractals. Please refer to the main repository README for further details.
